		<p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. Bear with me <p>in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at the most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried by the fear of 'doubling' lines, reading three words as one, and so forth. Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a 'modernist' in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he asked of his particular object was not 'How should it look?' but 'What must it do?' and to that extent all good typography is modernist. Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the central ritual of religion in one place and time, and attacked by a virago with a hatchet in another. There is only one thing in the world that is capable of stirr<p>ing and altering men's minds to the same extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's chief miracle, unique to man. There is no 'explanation' whatever of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds which will lead a total stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking, broadcasting, writing, and printing are all quite literally forms of thought transference, and it is the ability and eagerness to transfer and receive the contents of the mind that is almost alone responsible for human civilization. If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, i.e. that the most important thing about printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography. Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house altogether. Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does not necessarily lead to. If books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility. A page set in 14-pt Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory tests, more 'legible' than one set in 11-pt Baskerville. A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the transparent goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to the inflections and speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you are falling asleep. When you listen to a song in a language you do not understand, part of your mind actually does fall asleep, leaving your quite separate aesthetic sensibilities to enjoy themselves unimpeded by your reasoning faculties. The fine arts do that; but that is not the purpose of printing. Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas. We may say, therefore, that printing may be delightful for many reasons, but that it is important, first and foremost, as a means of doing something. That is why it is mischievous to call any printed piece a work of art, especially fine art: because that would imply that its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for the delectation of the senses. Calligraphy can almost be considered a fine art nowadays, because its primary economic and educational purpose has been taken away; but printing in English will not qualify as an art until the present English language no longer conveys ideas to future generations, and until printing itself hands its usefulness to some yet unimagined successor. There is no end to the maze of practices in typography, and this idea of printing as a conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great typographers with whom I have had the privilege of talking, the one clue that can guide you through the maze. Without this essential humility of mind, I have seen ardent designers go more hopelessly wrong, make more ludicrous mistakes out of an excessive enthusiasm, than I could have thought possible. And with this clue, this purposiveness in the back of your mind, it is possible to do the most unheard-of things, and find that they justify you triumphantly. It is not a waste of time to go to the simple fundamentals and reason from them. In the flurry of your individual problems, I think you will not mind spending half an hour on one broad and simple set of ideas involving abstract principles. I once was talking to a man who designed a very pleasing advertising type which undoubtedly all of you have used. I said something about what artists think about a certain problem, and he replied with a beautiful gesture: 'Ah, madam, we artists do not think---we feel!' That same day I quoted that remark to another designer of my acquaintance, and he, being less poetically inclined, murmured: 'I'm not feeling very well today, I think!' He was right, he did think; he was the thinking sort; and that is why he is not so good a painter, and to my mind ten times better as a typographer and type designer than the man who instinctively avoided anything as coherent as a reason. I always suspect the typographic enthusiast who takes a printed page from a book and frames it to hang on the wall, for I believe that in order to gratify a sensory delight he has mutilated something infinitely more important. I remember that T.M. Cleland, the famous American typographer, once showed me a very beautiful layout for a Cadillac booklet involving decorations in colour. He did not have the actual text to work with in drawing up his specimen pages, so he had set the lines in Latin. This was not only for the reason that you will all think of; if you have seen the old typefoundries' famous Quousque Tandem copy (i.e. that Latin has few descenders and thus gives a remarkably even line). No, he told me that originally he had set up the dullest 'wording' that he could find (I dare say it was from Hansard), and yet he discovered that the man to whom he submitted it would start reading and making comments on the text. I made some remark on the mentality of Boards of Directors, but Mr Cleland said, 'No: you're wrong; if the reader had not been practically forced to read---if he had not seen those words suddenly imbued with glamour and significance---then the layout would have been a failure. Setting it in Italian or Latin is only an easy way of saying "This is not the text as it will appear".'Let me start my specific conclusions with book typography, because that contains all the fundamentals, and then go on to a few points about advertising. The book typographer has the job of erecting a window between the reader inside the room and that landscape which is the author's words. He may put up a stained-glass window of marvellous beauty, but a failure as a window; that is, he may use some rich superb type like text gothic that is something to be looked at, not through. Or he may work in what I call transparent or invisible typography. I have a book at home, of which I have no visual recollection whatever as far as its typography goes; when I think of it, all I see is the Three Musketeers and their comrades swaggering up and down the streets of Paris. The third type of window is one in which the glass is broken into relatively small leaded panes; and this corresponds to what is called 'fine printing' today, in that you are at least conscious that there is a window there, and that someone has enjoyed building it. That is not objectionable, because of a very important fact which has to do with the psychology of the subconscious mind. That is that the mental eye focuses through type and not upon it. The type which, through any arbitrary warping of design or excess of 'colour', gets in the way of the mental picture to be conveyed, is a bad type. Our subconsciousness is always afraid of blunders (which illogical setting, tight spacing and too-wide unleaded lines can trick us into), of boredom, and of officiousness. The running headline that keeps shouting at us, the line that looks like one long word, the capitals jammed together without hair-spaces---these mean subconscious squinting and loss of mental focus.And if what I have said is true of book printing, even of the most exquisite limited editions, it is fifty times more obvious in advertising, where the one and only justification for the purchase of space is that you are conveying a message---that you are implanting a desire, straight into the mind of the reader. It is tragically easy to throw away half the reader-interest of an advertisement by setting the simple and compelling argument in a face which is uncomfortably alien to the classic reasonableness of the book-face. Get attention as you will by your headline, and make any pretty type pictures you like if you are sure that the copy is useless as a means of selling goods; but if you are happy enough to have really good copy to work with, I beg you to remember that thousands of people pay hard-earned money for the privilege of reading quietly set book-pages, and that only your wildest ingenuity can stop people from reading a really interesting text. Printing demands a humility of mind, for the lack of which many of the fine arts are even now floundering in self-conscious and maudlin experiments. Vulgar ostentation is twice as easy as discipline. When you realise that ugly typography never effaces itself; you will be able to capture beauty as the wise men capture happiness by aiming at something else. The 'stunt typographer' learns the fickleness of rich men who hate to read. Not<p> for them are long breaths held over serif and kern, they will not appreciate your splitting of hair-spaces. Nobody (save the other craftsmen) will appreciate half your skill. But you may spend endless years of happy experiment in devising that crystalline goblet which is worthy to hold the vintage of the human mind.

		McCoy, Katherine, 'Rethinking Modernism, Revising Functionalism', 'Looking Closer: Critical Writings on Graphic Design', Bierut, Drenttel, Heller and Holland, eds., Allworth Press, New York, 1994, p. 49.When I think of the undercurrents that shape my graphic design, I think of ideas about language and form. Ideas about coding and reading visual form, about challenging the viewer to construct individual interpretations, about layers of form and layers of meaning. These are at the forefront of my mind, but behind that lie other deeper and older concerns that go back to my earliest years of design. Perhaps these are what could be called a philosophy or an ethic, a personal set of values and criteria, a thread that winds through the lifetime of work and sustains its rigor, the continuity in the cycles of change. Through these years of continual change and new possibilities, where does the ethic lie? Does not the idea of ethic imply some sort of unshakable bedrock impervious to the winds of change? For me, there seems to be a habit of functionalism that shapes my process at the beginning of every design project, the rational analysis of the message and the audience, the objective structuring of the text. Each cycle of change during the passing years seems to have added another visual or conceptual layer laid upon that foundation of functionalism, but inside of every project it is always there. Although this emphasis on rationalism would seem to be at odds with recent experimentation at Cranbrook, in fact it has been the provocation to question accepted norms in graphic design, stimulating the search for new communications theories and visual languages. I have never lost my faith in rational functionalism, in spite of appearances to the contrary. The only thing lost was an absolute dedication to minimalist form, which is a completely different issue from rationalist process. Part of this ethic is a strong conviction and enthusiasm that design is important, that it matters in life, not just mine, but in the lives of our audiences and users of designed communications. Graphic design can be a contribution to our audiences. It can enrich as it informs and communicates. And there is a faith in not only the possibility, but the necessity for advancement and growth in our field, an imperative for change. That only through change can we continue to push ahead in knowledge and expertise, theory and expression, continually building our collective knowledge of the process of communication. These convictions were formed early and sustain me today. In a recent lecture, Ed Fella references a collage he made earlier in his long and prolific career as both a self-proclaimed “commercial artist” and iconoclastic figure in the graphic design avant-garde. It shows various tools: a T-square, a compass, a bottle of ink, a cup of coffee, a burnisher, an ashtray—re-creating the work surface of a typical graphic designer circa 1975. He deadpans to the audience: “The only thing left is the coffee.” Today, the typical desktop of the graphic designer is a virtual one invented for them in the famed confines of Xerox Park and Apple Computer: some folders, a ticking wristwatch, a trash can, and a bomb. Perhaps nothing better illustrates the transformation of a profession from handicraft to technocrat, from skilled labor to managed service, than this metaphorical transformation of a workspace. What supposedly distinguishes humans from their primate ancestors is their ability not to use tools but to integrate them into everyday activities, find fresh uses for them, and to create new ones. This evolutionary sequence was famously immortalized on the silver screen in Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which opens with a group of early apelike humans learn<p>ing to use a bone as both a tool and a weapon. After they triumphantly defeat a rival group, the bone is tossed into the air and transforms into an orbital satellite, a scene set some four million years in the future. The film’s main characters, Dave the astronaut, and HAL, his spaceship’s computer, eventually play out another cautionary tale about technology, as the human triumphs over the machine only to discover even higher-level and functioning extraterrestrial life, setting the stage for humankind’s next transformative evolution.Dave reborn as a kind of “star child” fetus gazes back upon the whole Earth—two spheres filling the screen, an amniotic sack and the proverbial big blue marble (Of course, this creative vision would not have been possible without the invention of the tools for fetal photography at one extreme, and satellite imagery taken from planetary orbit at the other.) Later in the same year as this epic film’s release, counterculture guru Sewart Brand would publish the first edition of The Whole Earth Catalog (1968), aptly subtitled “access to tools.” This sixty-four-page premier issue, which would eventually grow to more than four hundred pages, brandished a cover image of our entire planet taken from a satellite. This compendium of the latest ideas, best practices, low-cost technologies, and useful tools of its time was part lifestyle bible and part workaday reference manual. Its lofty objective stated: “ We are as gods and might as well get good at it. So far remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where the gross defects obscure actual gain. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of the intimate, person power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.” The Whole Earth Catalog prestaged the introduction of the ultimate tool, the personal computer, and the technological ethos of today’s Internet culture that it would spawn: the world of self-publishing, user-generated and aggregated content, open source systems, distributive platforms such as app stores, and the networks and connectivity of social media, cloud computing, and file sharing. As Steve Jobs explained it to a graduating class at Stanford in 2005, “It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along.” Human use of tools has been theorized as an explanation for human evolution stimulating such things as increased brain size coupled with the unique human ability to mimic behavior and thus spread ideas and techniques, which led to the rise of agriculture, the domestication of animals and, well, civilization itself. The tool in effect transforms our material and virtual realities and, by doing so, it transforms us. Despite the grandiosity of the vision, the typical segregation one sees in the culture at large and in the design profession in particular, between hand skills and head skills—making and thinking—seems therefore both regretful and artificial. Nevertheless, this segregation of conception and production remains at the heart of much professional discourse and angst. Graphic design was the first profession to be impacted by the introduction of the personal computer in the 1980s; its strategic objective was, after all, “desktop publishing.” More precisely, it transformed and eventually eliminated the work of various production artists, photomechanical technicians, keyliners, paste-up artists, typesetters, color separators and even some printers. It disrupted a field that has always had a rather confused and conflicted relationship between the spheres of creation and production, often separating conception from the labor and skill required to transform intentions and instructions into reproducible mass commodities. This separation reflected the divide created between the white-collar world of intellectual labor and the blue-collar world of manual labor—a division that continues to play itself out. However, what the personal computer took away from the workforce in jobs, it gave back to the graphic designer in ways both good and bad by increasing the ease and speed of visualizing ideas while simultaneously shortening the expected turnaround time of projects. The computer’s efficiency exponentially increased both the number of variations designers thought possible and the amount of changes clients deemed necessary. Its synthesis of formerly discrete functions in the process of designing promised designers a return to control over the craft and execution of work without properly preparing them for the types of skills that were formerly outsourced. Optimistic by nature and eschewing initial angst, graphic designers embraced the computer as just another tool on their creative workbench rather than as a replacement for them or their colleagues in the production process. Writing in 1998, about a decade after the personal computer was introduced in graphic design, Lorraine Wild would note the paradox of the situation at hand: “...many graphic designers believe that our futures depend on our ability to deliver conceptual solutions; but, ironically, digital technology has driving production back into the office, requiring constant attention. Design practice today requires the intellectual power of a thin tank and the turnaround capacity of a quickie-printer.” Of course, this new tool was made not just for designers, but targeted at a general audience. Graphic design had emerged as a professional service similar to fields such as industrial design and architecture by relying on a cadre of skilled technicians and industries to realize its products. The sudden open access to the tools of producing graphic design meant that the traditional gatekeeping function of the profession was eroded and would eventually be circumvented. On the upside was demystification: not only did lay people such as your mother know what a font was, but general awareness of the activity of designing also increased, thereby fueling broader interest and producing more designers. This, in turn, produced a corresponding downside for the profession, which experienced increased competition, cheaper wages, a flood of amateur work, and an erosion of craft. Perhaps the most ominous effect for designers was the recasting of graphic design as just another tool. Of course, the computer is not just another tool, nor is it simply a combination of discrete tools, a kind of digital Swiss army knife. Rather, the computer is a meta-tool: it makes other tools. Or as Jonathan Puckey, creator of tools such as Text Penil and the online dictionary for the Stedelijk Museum Bureau AMsterdam (SMBA) states: “Instead of collectively agreeing to the same streamlined tools sold to us by large software companies, we need to reclaim the personal relationship we used to have with our tools. We need to reintroduce interesting points of friction in our highly optimized software. We must learn to create tools ourselves. After all, the computer is exactly that: a tool for creating tools.” A new generation of designers is doing precisely this. For instance, Jürg Lehni wrote Scriptographer, a program that translates digital vectors to more analog devices such as Hektor, a robot-operated spray-paint device: Empty Words, a machine for making die-cut message posters; or Viktor, a chalk-drawing machine. Casey Reas and Ben Fry created Processing, an open source programming language that many other designers have used to create visualizations. Nicholas Felton and Ryan Case’s app Daytum, which can help track personal data, was originally created for use in his personal Annual Report projects. These examples point to a new phase of maturation for design’s relationship to technology, when the definition of design extends to the creation of new tools that enable and empower others to design. Ever since the d<p>emise of the medieval craft guild, modern design had sought to separate itself from one-off hand production in favor of mass-produced objects that bore few traces of the hand and more of the machine, the new laborer. Freed from production, the modern designer had to devise methods so that his intentions could be faithfully realized by others. Drawings, pasted-up layouts, instructional overlays coordinated color systems, standardized ink formulation and paper sizes, prototypes, models, and reprographic proofs were just some of the instruments invented to ensure that the faithfulness of a designer’s vision was executed according to plan. The separation of conception and planning from making and production were therefore part and parcel of being a modern designer. Craft, as such, did not disappear. It remained with acts of manual fabrication and was called precision in the case of machine production. For the designer, the values of craft were personally embodied in the acts of designing—all the processes and techniques necessary to envision and produce executable plans: drawing, rendering, making comps (a collage of materials used to simulate a printed piece) and mechanicals (a layout of type and images that was photographed for reproduction). Knowledge about production was a necessary part of any design education, gained in the classroom through books such as James Craig’s 1974 classic Production for the Graphic Designer, or in the workplace, whether it was how something was printed or bound in the case of graphic design, or manufactured and engineered in the case of products. Wild’s aforementioned essay offered another definition of craft for graphic designers, one positioned against the prevailing wisdom of the marketplace and the winds of of technological change sweeping through the profession of the 1990s. her essay was not a nostalgic impulse to save graphic graphic design; rather, it articulated the value of craft as integral, tacit knowledge, the type gained through direct experience and know-how, just as valid as theoretical knowledge, which is more distanced and descriptive. She quotes Malcolm McCullogh from his book Abstracting Craft: “The meaning of our work is connected to how it is made, not just ‘concepted.’” For Wild, the ultimate value of craft is tied to how we view the work of graphic designers over many years and across disparate projects. It is the connective thread that makes sense of so much labor and identifies the body of work with a particular person “When craft is put into the framework of graphic design, this might constitute what is meant by the ‘designer’s voice’—that part of design that is not industriously addressing the ulterior motives of a project, but instead follows the inner agenda of the designers craft. This guides the ‘body of work’ of a designer over and beyond the particular goal of each project. So craft is about tactics and concepts, seeking opportunities in the gaps of what is known rather than trying to organize everything in a unifying theory.” While Wild’s definition of craft made sense for graphic designers, it was not enough to halt the juggernaut of self-doubt that plagued the profession, which wasn’t so worried about the loss of craft as much as the perceived devaluation of their skill. After all, if what you used to produce could be done by anyone with a computer, what does anyone need a designer for? Or, in business-speak: as a designer, what’s your value-added? The natural instinct for self-preservation on the part of graphic designers required a new story about the value of design. Since the immediate impression was that the computer simply devalued traditional skills, the answer was to be found not in production, but in the realm of conception. This path was chosen despite the fact that the computer could not immediately demystify the more intangible aspects of design work: the craft of typography, the form-making skills honed in years of education and practice, the passion and devotion to an activity that many likened to an artistic pursuit, or the problem-solving skills, communication strategies, and ideation techniques learned typically through experience. Despite these important distinctions between novices and professionals, the field pursued a trajectory that emphasized its more verbal (as opposed to visual) and businesslike (rather than artistlike) attributes. Entire new sectors emerged devoted to left-brain pursuits such as design management, design strategy and innovation for business, and the design of services and systems, including consumer experiences, whether in bricks and mortar spaces or online. What these kinds of practices share is a belief in the power of ideas, words and research to shape design, one that recasts design’s productive labor as a primarily conceptual and managerial activity. Sometimes inadvertently and occasionally purposefully, this pursuit devalues the formal, the visual, and the material aspects of design as it shuns what it considers the more decorative, trendy, and superficial characteristics associated with design. If only they had taken a page from critic Virginia Postrel, who argues for style, and surface in an age dominated by the visual: “this new era challenges all of us—designers, engineers, business executives, and the public at large—to think differently about the relation between surface and substance, aesthetics and value. Designers have long lived in fear that people will not think that they’re frivolous, treating their work as ‘pretty but dumb,’ denigrating their hard-won expertise, and putting them first in line for budget cuts. Nearly every definition of design starts emphatically by stating that the profession isn’t just about surfaces.” But of course graphic designers are in fact producers of surfaces, millions of them. This production is so vast that it is comparable to the built environment, as Metahaven notes : “ The production of surface is design’s equivalent to the production of space.” Perhaps ironically, just as graphic designers were making their way out of the wilderness of “dumb” form to a higher conceptual plane, many other people—amateurs, lay people, and younger designers—were discovering a renewed passion for making, largely through hand processes and occasionally in reaction to digital technologies. This is the do-it-yourself entrepreneurial culture that has found a way to seize both the means of production and the systems of distribution, whose immense inventory can be found on websites such as Etsy, Threadless, and Supermarket, or bought, traded, and shared at gatherings such as Flatstock or the NY Art Book Fair. A “handmade nation” is seen in the resurgent popularity of more hands-on printing techniques such as letterpress and silkscreen, but is equally present in the general cultural renaissance of artisanal endeavors of all sorts, whether it be fashioning classic cocktails, cultivating heirloom vegetables, butchering and curing your own meats, or the impassioned fringe production of guerrilla gardening and urban knitting. Where an older generation of designers used to worry about transforming professional (i.e., conventional) practice to accommodate their work or fret about how to reach a more sympathetic audience for their wares, today’s designers simply produce now and ask questions later. It is symptomatic of a younger generation of graphic designers who have in essence created a market largely by themselves and targeted to people like them. This torrent of production is accessible and circulated around the Internet on various sites, the names of which give some indication of both the sense of discovery and the seemingly ad hoc nature of the hunt: Tumblr, StumbleUpon, Flickr, VVork, Ffffound!, Behance, ManyStuff. This is the twenty-first-century version of show-and-tell, or more appropriately, make-and-post—a visual, self-perpetuating archive of millennial portfolio culture. The atmosphere and tone of these sites and the work on them is quite different than it was in decades past. Gone is the air of skepticism, criticism, and even pessimism of the 1990s.  In its place is a new-found optimism, the ecstasy of production. As Experimental Jetset notes: “It’s almost a punk/DIY explosion of graphic design: bold geometric forms, bright colors, large sheets of printed paper, experiments in folding. People proudly displaying posters that they made, by simply holding them in the air Work that is unapologetically graphic. When we look at all these young students, shaping their immediate environment in such a concrete direct way, we feel really happy.” And who wouldn’t? The attitude, like a smile, is infectious. But if i could channel my old ‘90s-era skeptical self for a moment. I would note how most of this work circulates in a free-floating contextless, post-critical space (or less charitably, I would use the word “vacuum” or “bubble”). The speed of information and the constant flow of new material and reaction to it creates an intense feedback loop, like a call-and-response of graphic design. It isn’t surprising then that so much of the work looks and feels of the same spirit. However, I wouldn’t want to judge by past standards. Old-school concepts such as an original, copy, and imitation make little sense in this new postproduction world. It isn’t about what is trendy (forms) as much as what is trending (topics). The old world of graphic design and production was, in effect, a preproduction enterprise. Design was everything before the reproduction of it: ideas made visible and intentions made transmittable. Today, for graphic designers, there is little debate for angst about this sphere of activity. Of course, designers are still expected to know about aspects of production, and many tasks are fully integrated into the layout and design software itself. Rather, the action lies elsewhere. On the one hand we see the activity of an all-encompassing, self-sustaining concept in the renaissance figure of the designer-as-producer—the creator and maker and perhaps even the distributor <p>of the work. This activity still carries with it overtones of authorship, of originality, and singularity. Its reference points are often premodern. On the other hand, we have the realm of postproduction, which is characterized by notions of coauthorship, reference, and collectivity. As its name suggests, this is an after-market world of preexisting forms that are in effect remade by the designer who stands in the position of the user, which is to say as the recipient or consumer of an existing work. But unlike traditional ideas of consumption, the object of postproduction is no longer simply consumed or used up, but rather extended, remade, and transformed. In this way, postproduction adds value to the product, occasionally through new use value (recycling, upcycling, or downcycling of products, for instance), but it more often gains in symbolic value. Take, for example, a competition sponsored by Greenpeace UK to redesign BP’s logo in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Hundreds of people submitted new versions based on BP’s official (award-winning) logo, and a kind of virtual tar and feathering of the corporation ensued.  Approaching the project in the same way they would an official brand redesign, these designers needed to trade carefully and strategically on the so-called brand equity of the original mark: too much transformation and the connection to the original mark would be lost: too little and it might go unnoticed. For the 2008 US presidential election, the campaign of Barack Obama employed a critically acclaimed logo that soon found its way to myriad reuses: hand-rendered on everything from yard signs and temporary tattoos to jack-o-lanterns and home-baked cookies. This spread of unintentional usage is what ad industry types call “viral,” a cultural meme that finds its way into the hearts and minds of consumers. It’s a coveted strategy that money can’t buy—literally. The designer in the realm of postproduction is a producer or orchestrator of frameworks,systems, and actions that enable design to happen. The traditional role of the designer as the sole creator of a work has been displaced; usurped by “contributors,” sometimes thousands of them. Take for instance three recent music video projects that employ crowdsourcing through the participation of numerous users who each contribute their part of the collective whole.  Director Chris Milk and media artist Aaron Koblin collaborated on the creation of The Johnny Cash Project (2010), an online music video project set to the late musician’s song “Ain’t No Grave.” Visitors to the site can contribute to the video, which is continuously updated by drawing over randomly selected key frames. Users can also choose several options for viewing, such as the highest rated frames, a director’s cut version of selected or curated images, or by style: realistic, abstract, etc. Both Milk and Koblin also collaborated on The Wilderness Downtown (2010), an online film for the band Arcade Fire. Exploiting the browser capabilities of Google Chrome, the project asks viewers to type in their childhood home address. Using Google Maps aerial and street views of the location, the video integrates this specific geographic information into the narrative of Arcade Fire’s “We Used to Wait.” Both projects emphasize not only the desire for personalization of content and customizable viewing options, but also the underlying capacity of collective creativity. Designers Jonathan Puckey and Roel Wouters have created a participatory interactive video for the band C-Mon & Kypski entitled One Frame of Fame (2010). Viewers can select frames of the video that accompany the song “More or Less,” and using their webcams shoot a replacement frame and upload the result. More than 34,000 users have struck their pose, contributing a piece of themselves to the collective whole. The project’s philosophical gravity seems to exist somewhere between Jean-Luc Godards’ claim that cinema is truth twenty-four times per second and Andy Warhol’s prediction that everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes. In the aggregated, participatory, user-generated content world of Web 2.0, cinematic truth is no stranger than fiction, but ever more compressed slices of reality. Another example is Experimental Jetset’s influential Beatles T-shirt design with the words “John & Paul & Ringo & George” emblazoned on the front, which soon became so enticing and useful that it spawned variations running the gamut from knockoffs to homages to parodies. In its broadest terms, the world of postproduction design can be stretched to encompass the design of otherwise preexisting but blank objects: tote bags, wallpaper, T-shirts, buttons, plates, posters, coffee cups, and so on. This is the projection of graphic design to every soft of surface. It is not by coincidence that these surfaces tend to be the commodity forms of design itself—available and handy formats, empty vessels waiting to be filled—affectionately known in the marketplace as “merch.” It should be noted (also unlike it was in the ‘90s) there is no sense of shame in engaging consumption in such an overt way. Thus, designers are like rock bands that sell their merchandise at concerts to their fans (which for many bands is a major source of revenue). Typically, the concept of postproduction in design comes from the world of film and media production, where prerecorded bits of cinematography, sound, special effects, and so on are brought together and edited to form an integrated whole .But this analogy suggests that the new product is greater than the sum of its parts. I don’t think that this can be said of postproduction in the cultural sense. In terms of art, postproduction is said to be about riffing on, reproducing, even re<p>exhibiting existing artworks or using objects outright that, in a context other than a gallery, might be called design. This suggests a kind of equivalency or tacit relationship between the preexisting work and the new one. Nicholas Bourriaud, who has written about these ideas in the context of contemporary art, invokes the DJ and the programmer as quintessential figures of postproduction. He writes positively: “these artists who insert their work into that of others contribute to the eradication of the traditional distinction between production and consumption, creation and copy, readymade and original work. The material they manipulate is no longer primary.” The language of postproduction speaks of sampling rather than appropriation, sharing as opposed to owning, formats instead of forms, curation (i.e., selection) over creation, and context as the prime determinant of form rather than content. It is a culture of re- : remix, reformat, reshuffle, reinterpret, reprogram, reschedule, reboot, repost, recycle. These strategies can be seen within the world of publishing in the form of the reissue or bootleg edition—material previously out of print, but necessarily out of copyright. Miriam Katzeff and James Hoff of Primary Information republish “lost” historical material that expands contemporary discourse such as their facsimile edition of the Great Bear pamphlet series (2007), a 1960s art journal. Four Corners Books reissues literary works in a series called Familiars, which are done in collaboration with artists who provide a new spin on classics such as Dracula (2008). Vanity Fair (2010), and The Picture of Dorian Gray (2007). The more surreptitious bootleg strategy can be seen in works such as St. Pierre & Miquelon’s Sexymachineray Issue A: Super Replica (2008), a facsimile copy of a journal originally created by members of Abake: In Winterhouse Editions’ The National Security Strategy of the United States of America *2003), which simply republished and distributed the official document from the US government that would become know as the Bush Doctrine; or or ROllo Press’ How to Build Your Own Living Structures (Revisited) (2009), a one-color Riso-printed copy of Ken Issacs’ classic 1974 book on DIY furniture which can be obtained only by exchange, not purchase. The remix or extended play strategy can be seen in Extended Caption (DDDG) (2009), a reinterpretation of the content from the influential design-cum-art magazine Dot Dot Dot that Bailey published and from which forty-three artifacts and essays were selected for display and inclusion in the book as captions. Just as the introduction of the personal computer opened the sphere of publishing to broader access and participation, the Web 2.0 world not only blurs the distinctions between designers and users but also between production and consumption. Labor is no longer discrete but dispersed, creation is no longer autonomous but interdependent. Consider three examples: 99designs is an online service that provides buyers a logo design for the low, low price of $99 (or, if you want exclusive rights to the design, then add another $199). Here, the art comes before the horse. Like earnest profiles on a dating site or a catalogue of mail-order brides, more than 13,000 preexisting logo designs are waiting for your “match.”  Choose one and the name of your business will be added to the design which can be further customized to meet y<p>our needs. Mechanical Turk is a service offered by Amazon.com that brings together people who need simple, so-called human intelligence tasks performed that cannot be done yet by a computer (such as judging the quality of images, identifying singers on music CDs, writing product descriptions) with those who perform them for a small fee, often just a few cents per job, resembling the digital equivalent of thousands of freelancers (i.e., contract workers) has been aggregated: outsourcing through crowdsourcing. The dubious quality and the ethical ambiguities of these enterprises aside, both of these examples are symptomatic of a larger cultural transformation around the notion of increasing immaterial labor and atomized work, and their effects on production and consumption.  Philip M. Parker, a business professor, is a pro<p>lific self-publisher who has produced more than 100,00 books using an automated process of online research, writing, and layout. He issues printed books and digital reports on a staggering range of topics, from a history of anime and medical sourcebooks in areas such as restless leg syndrome and cataract surgeries to business reports about everything from the demand for wood toilet seats in China and lemon-flavored bottled water seals in Japan to golf bag sales in India. Parker uses a “long tail” approach of selling fewer copies in many more books to niche customers. This strategy, coupled with the near elimination of human labor have produced an inverted publishing venture, one in which a detailed report highly beneficial to just a few or even one person can yield a profit with prices in the hundreds of dollars. These tasks are often accomplished in less than thirty minutes using fully automated systems, most often including print-on-demand (eliminating inventory expense), whose production expense can be measured as “12 cents of electricity.” The old schism between intellectual and manual labor that seems at the heart of the graphic design profession’s internal debates is outmoded not only because the division is theoretically suspect, but also because it considers only the actions and possible roles of its own official agents (designers) instead of the complex and fluid social relationship and networks in which they are entwined with other players, who may or may not perform their own creative and productive roles. Metahaven, in Whit Night Before A Manifesto (2008), explores the inability of design manifestos to effect change: “Now that the principal tools of design—the computer and its software—have been homogenized among practitioners and democratized among people, professional distinction is an unlikely perspective for a future design manifesto to gain support. User-generated content accounts not for an amateurish supplement to a stable, professional core, but for a fundamental transformation of the workforce and the value it creates. The professional core of designers will not regain the central role it once could claim based on its mastery of tools and services unavailable to users. It seems instead more probable that among those professional designers, a gap will increase between those who design as celebrity and those design as labourer. Suc<p>h a gap has already appeared in the architectural profession. Subsequently, for a design manifesto, a new alliance between designers and users may be a potentially more successful way forward.” Metahaven goes on to cite the “GNU Manifesto” (1985) by Richard Stallman as a successful example of radically rethinking the entire notion of commissioned work, intellectual property rights, and collective ownership. Stallman’s proposal was one that would form the basis of the free software movement, and would inspire the open source computing, filesharing and copyleft movements. All of these take as their foundation the rights of creators to form an alliance directly with users to share their work. This declaration originally took place within a social framework very different from today’s, but prescient of its emergence. Its radical yet simple proposition, offered by a programmer—the symbolic figure of postproduction—declares: “I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it.”

		<p>The developments in typeface design, typesetting and printing have always been aimed at the improvement of “quality”. Compared to printing techniques as they existed in the early 15th century we have indeed come a long way. We can digitally output the most perfectly drawn typefaces onto film in resolutions of up to 5000 lines per inch. We can print in offset, in perfect registration, on the smoothest papers and finish it off with layers of varnish, all at a speed that our 15th century forefathers would find baffling. Technically we can create the slickest printing ever, reach the highest possible quality ever. Unfortunately, the results have too often become absolutely boring. The quality of a printed product, the high resolution of its typefaces, the perfect printing are not necessarily what makes for good design or clear communication.As a reaction to this development, we decided to create a typeface that would add liveliness to the page that has since long been lost using the modern technologies available. Our typeface would have a high resolution distortion of its digital outlines with lengthy rasterizing times as opposed to most developments in digital type: the unsmooth and slow versus the slick and quick. Type has always been in flux. Gutenberg started with whole copied pages cut from a single piece of wood. All the characters were hand-cut and no two a’s were the same. And did anyone mind? Gutenberg imitated handwriting because it was the only model of letterforms available at that<p> time. He simply developed a process that was already there, but he succeeded in doing it faster. Only later were the advantages of movable type exploited, when hot metal type casting techniques made it possible to create large quantities of type in a relatively inexpensive fashion. This was also the period when letterforms started taking advantage of this new medium. Bodoni cut serifs so thin that it would have been impossible to produce them out of wood. It has always taken a while for people to realize the potential of a new technology. Today’s fonts work the way they do because they are still created in a hot metal, movable type kind of way. Their design is based upon the process of punchcutting, which creates a matrix from which an infinite number of identical copies of each letter can be made. Digital type may even “crash” just as hot metal typesetting did. And, ironically, digital type has resulted in a revival of old style and non-lining numerals and even small caps. The usage of type is still based upon the proverbial typecases that were divided into different compartments, each for a different letter. When a certain letter is needed, it is put in line with the others to make words and sentences. Today the typecase is replaced by a font and a digital printer. Through our experience with traditional typesetting methods, we have come to expect that the individual letterforms of a particular typeface should always look the same. This notion is the result of a technical process, not the other way round. However, there is no technical reason for making a digital letter the same every time it is printed. It is possible to calculate every point and every curve differently each time the letter is generated by slightly moving the points that define a character in various “random” directions. We discovered that it was possible to create a font featuring these characteristics in PostScript; our result was Beowolf, the first “RandomFont” typeface of its kind. [Actually, Knuth got there first and he was nice about it.] Random technology, which is what we call the programming that is involved, is about letting the rasterizer behave randomly within the boundaries of legibility. Instead of recreating a fixed outline or bitmap, the Randomfont redefines its outlines every time they are called for. Thus, each character will be different each time it is printed. All the points that define the outline of any character will be nudged in a random direction. The distance moved depends on the parameters. For instance, Beowolf 21 has a little deviation, Beowolf 22 has a noticable wrinkle and Beowolf 23 is definitely mad. What is interesting about this typeface is that the deviations in the individual letterforms create an overall unity and the liveliness of the page that we were after is accomplished. We also discovered an interesting side effect when creating color separations for four color printing. Since the printer (Linotronic in this case) generates different outlines each time it prints a particular letter, the color separation will result in four different non-matching films. The resulting letterform in print will be outlined in bright colors. While working on Randomfont we became aware that if we treated typefaces as computer data, instead of fixed letterforms, we could create some very bizarre systems. One idea was to connect a font file to a self copying moving mechanism to create a virus font; a self distributing typeface: a great way for young and ambitious type designers to get their typefaces known and used. No type manufacturer would be able to compete with that kind of immediate proliferation. Or we could change typographic awareness of computer users around the world by creating a font virus that would transform every Helvetica into something much more desirable — the Post-modern typographer’s revenge. Virowolves that travel around the world in a single day, with typedesigners getting paid by buying network shares. Or we could hand out our fonts at conferences and meetings, but after a while the files will turn sour just like milk. A perfectly good font would turn random over time. A great way to force people to eventually buy a legitimate copy. And you better hurry, or the virus font will affect your other fonts as well! We could release a typeface that deteriorates over time, slowly turning into a Beowolf-like face, scaring the hell out of its users. We cou<p>ld create letters that wear out through frequent use, combined with a feature that uses up certain often used letters. You want real letterpress quality? You can get it! How about a font that adds typos? Link a number of typos to a particular time of the day and simulate an erratic (human) typesetter, or a font that does not work overtime. If we put more data into our typefaces we can have some very intelligent fonts. Some applications could be quite practical. For instance the data could include the information to create automatic inktraps that would switch on or off automatically, or as specified by the user, depending on the size of the type or printing technique used. A font would modify its outline when it is to be printed in offset, or shown on TV or screened on wood, or whatever. Or a typeface could research weather data, in particular the amount of direct sunlight on the spot where it will be printed, and modify itself to the best possible contrast. The idea of Randomfont can be applied elsewhere too. Why should a letterhead always be the same? It can be slightly different each day. If you print your correspondence or invoices on a LaserWriter, you can have a randomlogo, a logo that changes itself, moves around the page or tells something interesting about your company, the person you are writing or the nature of the letter. The dynamic logo can be much more informative than its fixed alternative. For years graphic designers, especially those who subscribe to the ideas and philosophies of Swiss design or modernism, have argued that logos and typefaces should appear consistent to establish recognition. We don’t think that this is necessary. Creating a randomlogo for a company, with letterheads and forms on which the logo would move around and change, does not necessarily decrease recognisability. Recognition does not come from simple repetition of the same form but is something much more intelligent, something that happens in our minds. When you hear somebody’s voice on the phone and he or she has a cold, you can still recognise who is talking. We can recognise handwriting, and even decipher how quickly a note was written and sometimes pick up on the state of mind the person was in when writing the note. Randomness and change can add new dimensions to printwork. Randomness within typography is not a revolutionary idea either. Typographers have always had to deal with randomness because type has always lacked standardization and consistency. One exam<p>ple is the measurement of type. With hot metal type everybody measured the body size of a typeface. With phototype and digital type there is no body to be measured. Some people like to measure the x-height, others the cap-height. Even the computer industry has added to the confusion. Software developers in different countries have each taken their national typographic standards and type measurement units and have written programs using their respective systems. This becomes a problem when for instance software written by an American developer is sold in Europe and the user must switch to the American measurement system. There are software programs that will interpret between the various existing measurement systems, but the conversions are performed internally. So two centimeters will inevitable output as 2.0001 or 1.9999 centimeters, it never works precisely. Randomness will always exist. There is definitely not going to be a universal set of standards for type and typography. Maybe randomness is an inevitable result of human behaviour. Gutenberg’s letters came out looking slightly different each time they were printed. Letters wore out, some got damaged, the impression onto the paper differed. However, overall the printed results had a vibrant and human quality. At some point during the developement of type and typography, the graphic design industry decided that is was necessary to improve upon the “quality” of printing and type. In the process due to economic and commercial considerations, much vitality was lost. We believe that the computer, although considered by many to be cold and impersonal, can bring back some of these lost qualities. Randomfont is our contribution to this idea.</p>

		<p>Is there any reason to make new fonts when there are so many already available for downloading? It's time to reflect on motivation to draw new type. While there is no reason to make uninspired new fonts, still, there are typefaces which haven’t been made yet and which we do need. It seems to be a golden age of type design—not only are there more type foundries now than ever before, not only is <p>distribution easier and more direct, not only is type a hot topic for numerous specialised blogs and magazines, but even the general interest media are in on the conversation, (if only occasionally). New type design courses are opening regularly, churning out legions of type designers. And there are now over 150,000 fonts available for direct download. In spite of all the attention to type and the unprecedented conditions for type designers, the vast majority of new fonts desperately lack originality. Just as in the music industry, where cover versions and remixes are often more popular than new music, font designers seemingly prefer to exploit successful models from the past rather than strive for new solutions. Scant decades ago, new typefaces underwent a rigorous review procedure to ensure that they met the publisher’s artistic and technical criteria. Today, self-publishing has eliminated such processes, and there is little critical review, little effort to add something new to the evolution of the profession. Mediocrity abounds as quality control dwindles. Dozens of blogs (as well as the print media) simply republish press releases without distinguishing between marketing and independent reviews, praising uninspired fonts and institutionalising the average. Many design awards do the same, perpetuating a false idea of what constitutes superior quality. We don’t need new fonts like this. In my decade of experience teaching at Type and Media I have seen many students enter the course with no previous experience in type design. Over the eight months of the course they learn the structure of letterforms and the principles of construction that allow them to create well-designed typefaces, (not always terribly original, but convincing executions without obvious mistakes). Having mastered the formal execution of type, they can then move on to think about how to apply their skills. Obviously, creating type that is too closely related to existing models doesn’t justify the effort involved. Or as my Type and Media colleague Erik van Blokland says: “If an existing typeface does the job, there is no reason to make a new one.” Many people drawing type today have solid drawing skills, but no desire to advance the field (let alone rebel against it) by creating original solutions. Can we call them type designers? I think not, at least not any more than we can call every fast, accurate typist a writer. Content is at least as important as form, the ideas we express as important as how we express them. Still, there are typefaces which haven’t been made yet and which we need. Type that reacts to our present reality rather than being constrained by past conventions; type for non-Latin scripts that gives its users more choices; type that brings readers from previous media to new ones. It is time to think about why we design type, not just how we design it. An epistemology of the word ‘experimental’ as it applies to design and type, contrasted with its scientific connotations. Examples of past and current design, type and reading/language, as well as scientific experiment, are taken into account. Very few terms have been used so habitually and carelessly as the word ‘experiment’. In the field of graphic design and typography, experiment as a noun has been used to signify anything new, unconventional, defying easy categorization, or confounding expectations. As a verb, ‘to experiment’ is often synonymous with the design process itself, which may not exactly be helpful, considering that all design is a result of the design process. The term experiment can also have the connotation of an implicit disclaimer; it suggests not taking responsibility for the result. When students are asked what they intend by creating certain forms, they often say, ‘It’s just an experiment…’, when they don’t have a better response. In a scientific context, an experiment is a test of an idea; a set of actions performed to prove or disprove a hypothesis. Experimentation in this sense is an empirical approach to knowledge that lays a foundation upon which others can build. It requires all measurements to be made objectively under controlled conditions, which allows the procedure to be repeated by others, thus proving that a phenomenon occurs after a certain action, and that the phenomenon does not occur in the absence of the action. An example of a famous scientific experiment would be Galileo Galilei’s dropping of two objects of different weights from the Pisa tower to demonstrate that both would land at the same time, proving his hypothesis about gravity. In this sense, a typographic experiment might be a procedure to determine whether humidity affects the transfer of ink onto a sheet of paper, and if it does, how. A scientific approach to experimentation, however, seems to be valid only in a situation where empirical knowledge is applicable, or in a situation where the outcome of the experiment can be reliably measured. What happens however when the outcome is ambiguous, non-objective, not based on pure reason? In the recent book The Typographic Experiment: Radical Innovation in Contemporary Type Design, the author Teal Triggs asked thirty-seven internationally-recognized designers to define their understandings of the term experiment. As expected, the published definitions couldn’t have been more disparate. They are marked by personal belief systems and biased by the experiences of the designers. While Hamish Muir of 8vo writes: ‘Every type job is experiment’, Melle Hammer insists that: ‘Experimental typography does not exist, nor ever has’. So how is it possible that there are such diverse understandings of a term that is so commonly used? Among the designers’ various interpretations, two notions of experimentation were dominant. The first one was formulated by the American designer David Carson: ‘Experimental is something I haven’t tried before … something that hasn’t been seen and heard’. Carson and several other designers suggest that the nature of experiment lies in the formal novelty of the result. There are many precedents for this opinion, but in an era when information travels faster than ever before and when we have achieved unprecedented archival of information, it becomes significantly more difficult to claim a complete novelty of forms. While over ninety years ago Kurt Schwitters proclaimed that to ‘do it in a way that no one has done it before’ was sufficient for the definition of the new typography of his day — and his work was an appropriate example of such an approach — today things are different. Designers are more aware of the body of work and the discourse accompanying it. Proclaiming novelty today can seem like historical ignorance on a designer’s part. Interestingly, Carson’s statement also suggests that the essence of experimentation is in going against the prevailing patterns, rather than being guided by conventions. This is directly opposed to the scientific usage of the word, where an experiment is designed to add to the accumulation of knowledge; in design, where results are measured subjectively, there is a tendency to go agains<p>t the generally accepted base of knowledge. In science a single person can make valuable experiments, but a design experiment that is rooted in anti-conventionalism can only exist against the background of other — conventional — solutions. In this sense, it would be impossible to experiment if one were the only designer on earth, because there would be no standard for the experiment. Anti-conventionalism requires going against prevailing styles, which is perceived as conventional. If more designers joined forces and worked in a similar fashion, the scale would change, and the former convention would become anti-conventional. The fate of such experimentation is a permanent confrontation with the mainstream; a circular, cyclical race, where it is not certain who is chasing whom. Does type design and typography allow an experimental approach at all? The alphabet is by its very nature dependent on and defined by conventions. Type design that is not bound by convention is like a private language: both lack the ability to communicate. Yet it is precisely the constraints of the alphabet which inspire many designers. A recent example is the work of Thomas Huot-Marchand, a French postgraduate student of type-design who investigates the limits of legibility while physically reducing the basic forms of the alphabet. Minuscule is his project of size-specific typography. While the letters for regular reading sizes are very close to conventional book typefaces, each step down in size results in simplification of the letter-shapes. In the extremely small sizes (2pt) Miniscule becomes an abstract reduction of the alphabet, free of all the details and optical corrections which are usual for fonts designed for text reading. Huot-Marchand’s project builds upon the work of French ophthalmologist Louis Emile Javal, who published similar research at the beginning of the 20th century. The practical contribution of both projects is limited, since the reading process is still guided by the physical limitations of the human eye, however, Huot-Marchand and Javal both investigate the constraints of legibility within which typography functions. The second dominant notion of experiment in The Typographic Experiment was formulated by Michael Worthington, a British designer and educator based in the USA: ‘True experimentation means to take risks.’ If taken literally, such a statement is of little value: immediately we would ask what is at stake and what typographers are really risking. Worthington, however, is referring to the risk involved with not knowing the exact outcome of the experiment in which the designers are engaged. A similar definition is offered by the E.A.T. (Experiment And Typography) exhibition presenting 35 type designers and typographers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which coincidentally will arrive in the Netherlands shortly. Alan Záruba and Johanna Balušíková, the curators of E.A.T. put their focus on development and process when describing the concept of the exhibition: ‘The show focuses on projects which document the development of designers’ ideas. Attention is paid to the process of creating innovative solutions in the field of type design and typography, often engaging experimental processes as a means to approach unknown territory.’ An experiment in this sense has no preconceived idea of the outcome; it only sets out to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. As such, experimentation is a method of working which is contrary to production-oriented design, where the aim of the process is not to create something new, but to achieve an already known, pre-formulated result. Belgian designer Brecht Cuppens has created Sprawl, an experimental typeface based on cartography, which takes into account the density of population in Belgium. In Sprawl, the silhouette of each letter is identical, so that when typed they lock into each other. The filling of the letters however varies according to the frequency of use of the letter in the Dutch language. The most frequently used letter (e) represents the highest density of population. The most infrequently used letter (q) corresponds to the lowest density. Setting a sample text creates a Cuppens representation of the Belgian landscape. Another example of experiment as a process of creation without anticipation of the fixed result is an online project . Ortho-type Trio of authors, Enrico Bravi, Mikkel Crone Koser, and Paolo Palma, describe ortho-type as ‘an exercise in perception, a stimulus for the mind and the eye to pick out and process three-dimensional planes on a flat surface…’. Ortho-type is an online application of a typeface designed to be recognizable in three dimensions. In each view, the viewer can set any of the available variables: length, breadth, depth, thickness, colour and rotation, and generate multiple variations of the model. The user can also generate those variations as a traditional 2D PostScript font. Although this kind of experimental process has no commercial application, its results may feed other experiments and be adapted to commercial activities. Once assimilated, the product is no longer experimental. David Carson may have started his formal experiments out of cu<p>riosity, but now similar formal solutions have been adapted by commercial giants such as Nike, Pepsi, or Sony. Following this line, we can go further to suggest that no completed project can be seriously considered experimental. It is experimental only in the process of its creation. When completed it only becomes part of the body of work which it was meant to challenge. As soon as the experiment achieves its final form it can be named, categorized and analyzed according to any conventional system of classification and referencing. An experimental technique which is frequently used is to bring together various working methods which are recognized separately but rarely combined. For example, language is studied systematically by linguists, who are chiefly interested in spoken languages and in the problems of analyzing them as they operate at a given point in time. Linguists rarely, however, venture into the visible representation of language, because they consider it artificial and thus secondary to spoken language. Typographers on the other hand are concerned with the appearance of type in print and other reproduction technologies; they often have substantial knowledge of composition, color theories, proportions, paper, etc., yet often lack knowledge of the language which they represent. These contrasting interests are brought together in the work of Pierre di Sciullo, a French designer who pursues his typographic research in a wide variety of media. His typeface Sintétik reduces the letters of the French alphabet to the core phonemes (sounds which distinguish one word from another) and compresses it to 16 characters. Di Sciullo stresses the economic aspect of such a system, with an average book being reduced by about 30% percent when multiple spellings of the same sound are made redundant. For example, the French words for skin (peaux) and pot (pot) are both reduced to the simplest representation of their pronunciation — po. Words set in Sintétik can be understood only when read aloud returning the reader to the medieval experience of oral reading. Quantange is another font specific to the French language. It is basically a phonetic alphabet which visually suggests the pronunciation, rhythm and pace of reading. Every letter in Quantange has as many different shapes as there are ways of pronouncing it: the letter c for example has two forms because it can be pronounced as s or k. Di Sciullo<p> suggests that Quantange would be particularly useful to foreign students of French or to actors and presenters who need to articulate the inflectional aspect of language not indicated by traditional scripts. This project builds on experiments of early avant-garde designers, the work of the Bauhaus, Kurt Schwitters, and Jan Tschichold. Di Sciullo took inspiration from the reading process, when he designed a typeface for setting the horizontal palindromes of Georges Perec (Perec has written the longest palindrome on record, a poem of 1388 words which can be read both ways, see http://graner.net/nicolas/salocin/ten.renarg//:ptth). The typeface is a combination of lower and upper case and is designed to be read from both sides, left and right. (This is great news to every Bob, Hannah or Eve.) Di Sciullo’s typefaces are very playful and their practical aspects are limited, yet like the other presented examples of experiments in typography, his works points to previously unexplored areas of interest which enlarge our understanding of the field. Although most of the examples shown here are marked by the recent shift of interest of European graphic design from forms to ideas, and the best examples combine both, there is no definitive explanation of what constitutes an experiment in typography. As the profession develops and more people practice this subtle art, we continually redefine the purpose of experimentation and become aware of its moving boundaries.

		<p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two g<p>oblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at the most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried by the fear of 'doubling' lines, reading three words as one, and so forth. Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a 'modernist' in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he asked of his particular object was not 'How should it look?' but 'What must it do?' and to that extent all good typography is modernist. Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the central ritual of religion in one place and time, and attacked by a virago with a hatchet in another. There is only one thing in the world that is capable of stirring and altering men's minds to the same extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's chief miracle, unique to man. There is no 'explanation' whatever of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds which will lead a total stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking, broadcasting, writing, and printing are all quite literally forms of thought transference, and it is the ability and eagerness to transfer and receive the contents of the mind th<p>at is almost alone responsible for human civilization. If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, i.e. that the most important thing about printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography. Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house altogether. Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does not necessarily lead to. If books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility. A page set in 14-pt Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory tests, more 'legible' than one set in 11-pt Baskerville. A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the transparent goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to the inflections and speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you are falling asleep. When you listen to a song in a language you do not understand, part of your mind actually does fall asleep, leaving your quite separate aesthetic sensibilities to enjoy themselves unimpeded by your reasoning faculties. The fine arts do that; but that is not the purpose of printing. Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas. We may say, therefore, that printing may be delightful for many reasons, but that it is important, first and foremost, as a means of doing something. That is why it is mischievous to call any printed piece a work of art, especially fine art: because that would imply that its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for the delectation of the senses. Calligraphy can almost be considered a fine art nowadays, because its primary economic and educational purpose has been taken away; but printing in English will not qualify as an art until the present English language no longer conveys ideas to future generations, and until printing itself hands its usefulness to some yet unimagined successor. There is no end to the maze of practices in typography, and this idea of printing as a conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great typographers with whom I have had the privilege of talking, the one clue that can guide you through the maze. Without this essential humility of mind, I have seen ardent designers go more hopelessly wrong, make more ludicrous mistakes out of an excessive enthusiasm, than I could have thought possible. And with this clue, this purposiveness in the back of your mind, it is possible to do the most unheard-of things, and find that they justify you triumphantly. It is not a waste of time to go to the simple fundamentals and reason from them. In the flurry of your individual problems, I think you will not mind spending half an hour on one broad and simple set of ideas involving abstract principles. I once was talking to a man who designed a very pleasing advertising type which undoubtedly all of you have used. I said something about what artists think about a certain problem, and he replied with a beautiful gesture: 'Ah, madam, we artists do not think---we feel!' That same day I quoted that remark to another designer of my acquaintance, and he, being less poetically inclined, murmured: 'I'm not feeling very well today, I think!' He was right, he did think; he was the thinking sort; and that is why he is not so good a painter, and to my mind ten times better as a typographer and type designer than the man who instinctively avoided anything as coherent as a reason. I always suspect the typographic enthusiast who takes a printed page from a book and frames it to hang on the wall, for I believe that in order to gratify a sensory delight he has mutilated something infinitely more important. I remember that T.M. Cleland, the famous American typographer, once showed me a very beautiful layout for a Cadillac booklet involving decorations in colour. He did not have the actual text to work with in drawing up his specimen pages, so he had set the lines in Latin. This was not only for the reason that you will all think of; if you have seen the old typefoundries' famous Quousque Tandem copy (i.e. that Latin has few descenders and thus gives a remarkably even line). No, he told me that originally he had set up the dullest 'wording' that he could find (I dare say it was from Hansard), and yet he discovered that the man to whom he submitted it would start reading and making comments on the text. I made some remark on the mentality of Boards of Directors, but Mr Cleland said, 'No: you're wrong; if the reader had not been practically forced to read---if he had not seen those words suddenly imbued with glamour and significance---then the layout would have been a failure. Setting it in Italian or Latin is only an easy way of saying "This is not the text as it will appear".'Let me start my specific conclusions with book typography, because that contains all the fundamentals, and then go on to a few points about advertising. The book typographer has the job of erecting a window between the reader inside the room and that landscape which is the author's words. He may put up a stained-glass window of marvellous beauty, but a failure as a window; that is, he may use some rich superb type like text gothic that is something to be looked at, not through. Or he may work in what I call transparent or invisible typography. I have a book at home, of which I have no visual recollection whatever as far as its typography goes; when I think of it, all I see is the Three Musketeers and their comrades swaggering up and down the streets of Paris. The third type of window is one in which the glass is broken into relatively small leaded panes; and this corresponds to what is called 'fine printing' today, in that you are at least conscious that there is a window there, and that someone has enjoyed building it. That is not objectionable, because of a very important fact which has to do with the psychology of the subconscious mind. That is that the mental eye focuses throu<p>gh type and not upon it. The type which, through any arbitrary warping of design or excess of 'colour', gets in the way of the mental picture to be conveyed, is a bad type. Our subconsciousness is always afraid of blunders (which illogical setting, tight spacing and too-wide unleaded lines can trick us into), of boredom, and of officiousness. The running headline that keeps shouting at us, the line that looks like one long word, the capitals jammed together without hair-spaces---these mean subconscious squinting and loss of mental focus.And if what I have said is true of book printing, even of the most exquisite limited editions, it is fifty times more obvious in advertising, where the one and only justification for the purchase of space is that you are conveying a message---that you are implanting a desire, straight into the mind of the reader. It is tragically easy to throw away half the reader-interest of an advertisement by setting the simple and compelling argument in a face which is uncomfortably alien to the classic reasonableness of the book-face. Get attention as you will by your headline, and make any pretty type pictures you like if you are sure that the copy is useless as a means of selling goods; but if you are happy enough to have really good copy to work with, I beg you to remember that thousands of people pay hard-earned money for the privilege of reading quietly set book-pages, and that only your wildest ingenuity can stop people from reading a really interesting text. Printing demands a humility of mind, for the lack of which many of t<p>he fine arts are even now floundering in self-conscious and maudlin experiments. Vulgar ostentation is twice as easy as discipline. When you realise that ugly typography never effaces itself; you will be able to capture beauty as the wise men capture happiness by aiming at something else. The 'stunt typographer' learns the fickleness of rich men who hate to read. Not for them are long breaths held over serif and kern, they will not appreciate your splitting of hair-spaces. Nobody (save the other craftsmen) will appreciate half your skill. But you may spend endless years of happy experiment in devising that crystalline goblet which is worthy to hold the vintage of the human mind.

		McCoy, Katherine, 'Rethinking Modernism, Revising Functionalism', 'Looking Closer: Critical Writings on Graphic Design', Bierut, Drenttel, Heller and Holland, eds., Allworth Press, New York, 1994, p. 49.When I think of the undercurrents that shape my graphic design, I think of ideas about language and form. Ideas about coding and reading visual form, about challenging the viewer to construct individual interpretations, about layers of form and layers of meaning. These are at the forefront of my mind, but behind that lie other deeper and older concerns that go back to my earliest years of design. Perhaps these are <p>what could be called a philosophy or an ethic, a personal set of values and criteria, a thread that winds through the lifetime of work and sustains its rigor, the continuity in the cycles of change. Through these years of continual change and new possibilities, where does the ethic lie? Does not the idea of ethic imply some sort of unshakable bedrock impervious to the winds of change? For me, there seems to be a habit of functionalism that shapes my process at the beginning of every design project, the rational analysis of the message and the audience, the objective structuring of the text. Each cycle of change during the passing years seems to have added another visual or conceptual layer laid upon that foundation of functionalism, but inside of every project it is always there. Although this emphasis on rationalism would seem to be at odds with recent experimentation at Cranbrook, in fact it has been the provocation to question accepted norms in graphic design, stimulating the search for new communications theories and visual languages. I have never lost my faith in rational functionalism, in spite of appearances to the contrary. The only thing lost was an absolute dedication to minimalist form, which is a completely different issue from rationalist process. Part of this ethic is a strong conviction and enthusiasm that design is important, that it matters in life, not just mine, but in the lives of our audiences and users of designed communications. Graphic design can be a contribution to our audiences. It can enrich as it informs and communicates. And there is a faith in not only the possibility, but the necessity for advancement and growth in our field, an imperative for change. That only through change can we continue to push ahead in knowledge and expertise, theory and expression, continually building our collective knowledge of the process of communication. These convictions were formed early and sustain me today. In a recent lecture, Ed Fella references a collage he made earlier in his long and prolific career as both a self-proclaimed “commercial artist” and iconoclastic figure in the graphic design avant-garde. It shows various tools: a T-square, a compass, a bottle of ink, a cup of coffee, a burnisher, an ashtray—re-creating the work surface of a typical graphic designer circa 1975. He deadpans to the audience: “The only thing left is the coffee.” Today, the typical desktop of the graphic designer is a virtual one invented for them in the famed confines of Xerox Park and Apple Computer: some folders, a ticking wristwatch, a trash can, and a bomb. Perhaps nothing better illustrates the transformation of a profession from handicraft to technocrat, from skilled labor to managed service, than this metaphorical transformation of a workspace. What supposedly distinguishes humans from their primate ancestors is their ability not to use tools but to integrate them into everyday activities, find fresh uses for them, and to create new ones. This evolutionary sequence was famously immortalized on the silver screen in Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which opens with a group of early apelike humans learning to use a bone as both a tool and a weapon. After they triumphantly defeat a rival group, the bone is tossed into the air and transforms into an orbital satellite, a scene set some four million years in the future. The film’s main characters, Dave the astronaut, and HAL, his spaceship’s computer, eventually play out another cautionary tale about technology, as the human triumphs over the machine only to discover even higher-level and functioning extraterrestrial life, setting the stage for humankind’s next transformative evolution.Dave reborn as a kind of “star child” fetus gazes back upon the whole Earth—two spheres filling the screen, an amniotic sack and the proverbial big blue marble (Of course, this creative vision would not have been possible without the invention of the tools for fetal photography at one extreme, and satellite imagery taken from planetary orbit at the other.) Later in the same year as this epic film’s release, counterculture guru Sewart Brand would publish the first edition of The Whole Earth Catalog (1968), aptly subtitled “access to tools.” This sixty-four-page premier issue, which would eventually grow to more than four hundred pages, brandished a cover image of our entire planet taken from a satellite. This compendium of the latest ideas, best practices, low-cost technologies, and useful tools of its time was part lifestyle bible and part workaday reference manual. Its lofty objective stated: “ We are as gods and might as well get good at it. So far remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where the gross defects obscure actual gain. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of the intimate, person power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.” The Whole Earth Catalog prestaged the introduction of the ultimate tool, the personal computer, and the technological ethos of today’s Internet culture that it would spawn: the world of self-publishing, user-generated and aggregated content, open source systems, distributive platforms such as app stores, and the networks and connectivity of social media, cloud computing, and file sharing. As Steve Jobs explained it to a graduating class at Stanford in 2005, “It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along.” Human use of tools has been theorized as an explanation for human evolution stimulating such things as increased brain size coupled with the unique human ability to mimic behavior and thus spread ideas and techniques, which led to the rise of agriculture, the domestication of animals and, well, civilization itself. The tool in effect transforms our material and virtual realities and, by doing so, it transforms us. Despite the grandiosity of the vision, the typical segregation one sees in the culture at large and in the design profession in particular, between hand skills and head skills—making and thinking—seems therefore both regretful and artificial. Nevertheless, this segregation of conception and production remains at the heart of much professional discourse and angst. Graphic design was the first profession to be impacted by the introduction of the personal computer in the 1980s; its strategic objective was, after all, “desktop publishing.” More precisely, it transformed and eventually eliminated the work of various production artists, photomechanical technicians, keyliners, paste-up artists, typesetters, color separators and even some printers. It disrupted a field that has always had a rather confused and conflicted relationship between the spheres of creation and production, often separating conception from the labor and skill required to transform intentions and instructions into reproducible mass commodities. This separation reflected the divide created between the white-collar world of intellectual labor and the blue-collar world of manual labor—a division that continues to play itself out. However, what the personal computer took away from the workforce in jobs, it gave back to the graphic designer in ways both good and bad by increasing the ease and speed of visualizing ideas while simultaneously shortening the expected turnaround time of projects. The computer’s efficiency exponentially increased both the number of variations designers thought possible and the amount of changes clients deemed necessary. Its synthesis of formerly discrete functions in the process of designing promised designers a return to control over the craft and execution of work without properly preparing them for the types of skills that were formerly outsourced. Optimistic by nature and eschewing initial angst, graphic designers embraced the computer as just another tool on their creative workbench rather than as a replacement for them or their colleagues in the production process. Writing in 1998, about a decade after the personal computer was introduced in graphic design, Lorraine Wild would note the paradox of the situation at hand: “...many graphic designers believe that our futures depend on our ability to deliver conceptual solutions; but, ironically, digital technology has driving production back into the office, requiring constant attention. Design practice today requires the intellectual power of a thin tank and the turnaround capacity of a quickie-printer.” Of course, this new tool was made not just for designers, but targeted at a general audience. Graphic design had emerged as a professional service similar to fields such as industrial design and architecture by relying on a cadre of skilled technicians and industries to realize its products. The sudden open access to the tools of producing graphic design meant that the traditional gatekeeping function of the profession was eroded and would eventually be circumvented. On the upside was demystification: not only did lay people such as your mother know what a font was, but general awareness of the activity of designing also increased, thereby fueling broader interest and producing more designers. This, in turn, produced a corresponding downside for the profession, which experienced increased competition, cheaper wages, a flood of amateur work, and an erosion of craft. Perhaps the most ominous effect for designers was the recasting of graphic design as just another tool. Of course, the computer is not just another tool, nor is it simply a combination of discrete tools, a kind of digital Swiss army knife. Rather, the computer is a meta-tool: it makes other tools. Or as Jonathan Puckey, creator of tools such as Text Penil and the online dictionary for the Stedelijk Museum Bureau AMsterdam (SMBA) states: “Instead of collectively agreeing to the same streamlined tools sold to us by large software companies, we need to reclaim the personal relationship we used to have with our tools. We need to reintroduce interesting points of friction in our highly optimized software. We must learn to create tools ourselves. After all, the computer is exactly that: a tool for creating tools.” A new generation of designers is doing precisely this. For instance, Jürg Lehni wrote Scriptographer, a program that translates digital vectors to more analog devices such as Hektor, a robot-operated spray-paint device: Empty Words, a machine for making die-cut message posters; or Viktor, a chalk-drawing machine. Casey Reas and Ben Fry created Processing, an open source programming language that many other designers have used to create visualizations. Nicholas Felton and Ryan Case’s app Daytum, which can help track personal data, was originally created for use in his personal Annual Report projects. These examples point to a new phase of maturation for design’s relationship to technology, when the definition of design extends to the creation of new tools that enable and empower others to design. Ever since the demise of the medieval craft guild, modern design had sought to separate itself from one-off hand production in favor of mass-produced objects that bore few traces of the hand and more of the machine, the new laborer. Freed from production, the modern designer had to devise methods so that his intentions could be faithfully realized by others. Drawings, pasted-up layouts, instructional overlays coordinated color systems, standardized ink formulation and paper sizes, prototypes, models, and reprographic proofs were just some of the instruments invented to ensure that the faithfulness of a designer’s vision was executed according to plan. The separation of conception and planning from making and production were therefore part and parcel of being a modern designer. Craft, as such, did not disappear. It remained with acts of manual fabrication and was called precision in the case of machine production. For the designer, the values of craft were personally embodied in the acts of designing—all the processes and techniques necessary to envision and produce executable plans: drawing, rendering, making comps (a collage of materials used to simulate a printed piece) and mechanicals (a layout of type and images that was photographed for reproduction). Knowledge about production was a necessary part of any design education, gained in the classroom through books such as James Crai<p>g’s 1974 classic Production for the Graphic Designer, or in the workplace, whether it was how something was printed or bound in the case of graphic design, or manufactured and engineered in the case of products. Wild’s aforementioned essay offered another definition of craft for graphic designers, one positioned against the prevailing wisdom of the marketplace and the winds of of technological change sweeping through the profession of the 1990s. her essay was not a nostalgic impulse to save graphic graphic design; rather, it articulated the value of craft as integral, tacit knowledge, the type gained through direct experience and know-how, just as valid as theoretical knowledge, which is more distanced and descriptive. She quotes Malcolm McCullogh from his book Abstracting Craft: “The meaning of our work is connected to how it is made, not just ‘concepted.’” For Wild, the ultimate value of craft is tied to how we view the work of graphic designers over many years and across disparate projects. It is the connective thread that makes sense of so much labor and identifies the body of work with a particular person “When craft is put into the framework of graphic design, this might constitute what is meant by the ‘designer’s voice’—that part of design that is not industriously addressing the ulterior motives of a project, but instead follows the inner agenda of the designers craft. This guides the ‘body of work’ of a designer over and beyond the particular goal of each project. So craft is about tactics and concepts, seeking opportunities in the gaps of what is known rather than trying to organize everything in a unifying theory.” While Wild’s definition of craft made sense for graphic designers, it was not enough to halt the juggernaut of self-doubt that plagued the profession, which wasn’t so worried about the loss of craft as much as the perceived devaluation of their skill. After all, if what you used to produce could be done by anyone with a computer, what does anyone need a designer for? Or, in business-speak: as a designer, what’s your value-added? The natural instinct for self-preservation on the part of graphic designers required a new story about the value of design. Since the immediate impression was that the computer simply devalued traditional skills, the answer was to be found not in production, but in the realm of conception. This path was chosen despite the fact that the computer could not immediately demystify the more intangible aspects of design work: the craft of typography, the form-making skills honed in years of education and practice, the passion and devotion to an activity that many likened to an artistic pursuit, or the problem-solving skills, communication strategies, and ideation techniques learned typically through experience. Despite these important distinctions between novices and professionals, the field pursued a trajectory that emphasized its more verbal (as opposed to visual) and businesslike (rather than artistlike) attributes. Entire new sectors emerged devoted to left-brain pursuits such as design management, design strategy and innovation for business, and the design of services and systems, including consumer experiences, whether in bricks and mortar spaces or online. What these kinds of practices share is a belief in the power of ideas, words and research to shape design, one that recasts design’s productive labor as a primarily conceptual and managerial activity. Sometimes inadvertently and occasionally purposefully, this pursuit devalues the formal, the visual, and the material aspects of design as it shuns what it considers the more decorative, trendy, and superficial characteristics associated with design. If only they had taken a page from critic Virginia Postrel, who argues for style, and surface in an age dominated by the visual: “this new era challenges all of us—designers, engineers, business executives, and the public at large—to think differently about the relation between surface and substance, aesthetics and value. Designers have long lived in fear that people will not think that they’re frivolous, treating their work as ‘pretty but dumb,’ denigrating their hard-won expertise, and putting them first in line for budget cuts. Nearly every definition of design starts emphatically by stating that the profession isn’t just about surfaces.” But of course graphic designers are in fact producers of surfaces, millions of them. This production is so vast that it is comparable to the built environment, as Metahaven notes : “ The production of surface is design’s equivalent to the production of space.” Perhaps ironically, just as graphic designers were making their way out of the wilderness of “dumb” form to a higher conceptual plane, many other people—amateurs, lay people, and younger designers—were discovering a renewed passion for making, largely through hand processes and occasionally in reaction to digital technologies. This is the do-it-yourself entrepreneurial culture that has found a way to seize both the means of production and the systems of distribution, whose immense inventory can be found on websites such as Etsy, Threadless, and Supermarket, or bought, traded, and shared at gatherings such as Flatstock or the NY Art Book Fair. A “handmade nat<p>ion” is seen in the resurgent popularity of more hands-on printing techniques such as letterpress and silkscreen, but is equally present in the general cultural renaissance of artisanal endeavors of all sorts, whether it be fashioning classic cocktails, cultivating heirloom vegetables, butchering and curing your own meats, or the impassioned fringe production of guerrilla gardening and urban knitting. Where an older generation of designers used to worry about transforming professional (i.e., conventional) practice to accommodate their work or fret about how to reach a more sympathetic audience for their wares, today’s designers simply produce now and ask questions later. It is symptomatic of a younger generation of graphic designers who have in essence created a market largely by themselves and targeted to people like them. This torrent of production is accessible and circulated around the Internet on various sites, the names of which give some indication of both the sense of discovery and the seemingly ad hoc nature of the hunt: Tumblr, StumbleUpon, Flickr, VVork, Ffffound!, Behance, ManyStuff. This is the twenty-first-century version of show-and-tell, or more appropriately, make-and-post—a visual, self-perpetuating archive of millennial portfolio culture. The atmosphere and tone of these sites and the work on them is quite different than it was in decades past. Gone is the air of skepticism, criticism, and even pessimism of the 1990s.  In its place is a new-found optimism, the ecstasy of production. As Experimental Jetset notes: “It’s almost a punk/DIY explosion of graphic design: bold geometric forms, bright colors, large sheets of printed paper, experiments in folding. People proudly displaying posters that they made, by simply holding them in the air Work that is unapologetically graphic. When we look at all these young students, shaping their immediate environment in such a concrete direct way, we feel really happy.” And who wouldn’t? The attitude, like a smile, is infectious. But if i could channel my old ‘90s-era skeptical self for a moment. I would note how most of this work circulates in a free-floating contextless, post-critical space (or less charitably, I would use the word “vacuum” or “bubble”). The speed of information and the constant flo<p>w of new material and reaction to it creates an intense feedback loop, like a call-and-response of graphic design. It isn’t surprising then that so much of the work looks and feels of the same spirit. However, I wouldn’t want to judge by past standards. Old-school concepts such as an original, copy, and imitation make little sense in this new postproduction world. It isn’t about what is trendy (forms) as much as what is trending (topics). The old world of graphic design and production was, in effect, a preproduction enterprise. Design was everything before the reproduction of it: ideas made visible and intentions made transmittable. Today, for graphic designers, there is little debate for angst about this sphere of activity. Of course, designers are still expected to know about aspects of production, and many tasks are fully integrated into the layout and design software itself. Rather, the action lies elsewhere. On the one hand we see the activity of an all-encompassing, self-sustaining concept in the renaissance figure of the designer-as-producer—the creator and maker and perhaps even the distributor of the work. This activity still carries with it overtones of authorship, of originality, and singularity. Its reference points are often premodern. On the other hand, we have the realm of postproduction, which is characterized by notions of coauthorship, reference, and collectivity. As its name suggests, this is an after-market world of preexisting forms that are in effect remade by the designer who stands in the position of the user, which is to say as the recipient or consumer of an existing work. But unlike traditional ideas of consumption, the object of postproduction is no longer simply consumed or used up, but rather extended, remade, and transformed. In this way, postproduction adds value to the product, occasionally through new use value (recycling, upcycling, or downcycling of products, for instance), but it more often gains in symbolic value. Take, for example, a competition sponsored by Greenpeace UK to redesign BP’s logo in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Hundreds of people submitted new versions based on BP’s official (award-winning) logo, and a kind of virtual tar and feathering of the corporation ensued.  Approaching the project in the same way they would an official brand redesign, these designers needed to trade carefully and strategically on the so-called brand equity of the original mark: too much transformation and the connection to the original mark would be lost: too little and it might go unnoticed. For the 2008 US presidential election, the campaign of Barack Obama employed a critically acclaimed logo that soon found its way to myriad reuses: hand-rendered on everything from yard signs and temporary tattoos to jack-o-lanterns and home-baked cookies. This spread of unintentional usage is what ad industry types call “viral,” a cultural meme that finds its way into the hearts and minds of consumers. It’s a coveted strategy that money can’t buy—literally. The designer in the realm of postproduction is a producer or orchestrator of frameworks,systems, and actions that enable design to happen. The traditional role of the designer as the sole creator of a work has been displaced; usurped by “contributors,” sometimes thousands of them. Take for instance three recent music video projects that employ crowdsourcing through the participation of numerous users who each contribute their part of the collective whole.  Director Chris Milk and media artist Aaron Koblin collaborated on the creation of The Johnny Cash Project (2010), an online music video project set to the late musician’s song “Ain’t No Grave.” Visitors to the site can contribute to the video, which is continuously updated by drawing over randomly selected key frames. Users can also choose several options for viewing, such as the highest rated frames, a director’s cut version of selected or curated images, or by style: realistic, abstract, etc. Both Milk and Koblin also collaborated on The Wilderness Downtown (2010), an online film for the band Arcade Fire. Exploiting the browser capabilities of Google Chrome, the project asks viewers to type in their childhood home address. Using Google Maps aerial and street views of the location, the video integrates this specific geographic information into the narrative of Arcade Fire’s “We Used to Wait.” Both projects emphasize not only the desire for personalization of content and customizable viewing options, but also the underlying capacity of collective creativity. Designers Jonathan Puckey and Roel Wouters have created a participatory interactive video for the band C-Mon & Kypski entitled One Frame of Fame (2010). Viewers can select frames of the video that accompany the song “More or Less,” and using their webcams shoot a replacement frame and upload the result. More than 34,000 users have struck their pose, contributing a piece of themselves to the collective whole. The project’s philosophical gravity seems to exist somewhere between Jean-Luc Godards’ claim that cinema is truth twenty-four times per second and Andy Warhol’s prediction that everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes. In the aggregated, participatory, user-generated content world of Web 2.0, cinematic truth is no stranger than fiction, but ever more compressed slices of reality. Another example is Experimental Jetset’s influential Beatles T-shirt design with the words “John & Paul & Ringo & George” emblazoned on the front, which soon became so enticing and useful that it spawned variations running the gamut from knockoffs to homages to parodies. In its broadest terms, the world of postproduction design can be stretched to encompass the design of otherwise preexisting but blank objects: tote bags, wallpaper, T-shirts, buttons, plates, posters, coffee cups, and so on. This is the projection of graphic design to every soft of surface. It is not by coincidence that these surfaces tend to be the commodity forms of design itself—available and handy formats, empty vessels waiting to be filled—affectionately known in the marketplace as “merch.” It should be noted (also unlike it was in the ‘90s) there is no sense of shame in engaging consumption in such an overt way. Thus, designers are like rock bands that sell their merchandise at concerts to their fans (which for many bands is a major source of revenue). Typically, the concept of postproduction in design comes from the world of film and media production, where prerecorded bits of cinematography, sound, special effects, and so on are brought together and edited to form an integrated whole .But this analogy suggests that the new product is greater than the sum of its parts. I don’t think that this can be said of postproduction in the cultural sense. In terms of art, postproduction is said to be about riffing on, reproducing, even reexhibiting existing artworks or using objects outright that, in a context other than a gallery, might be called design. This suggests a kind of equivalency or tacit relationship between the preexisting work and the new one. Nicholas Bourriaud, who has written about these ideas in the context of contemporary art, invokes the DJ and the programmer as quintessential figures of postproduction. He writes positively: “these artists who insert their work into that of others contribute to the eradication of the traditional distinction between production and consumption, creation and copy, readymade and original work. The material they manipulate is no longer primary.” The language of postproduction speaks of sampling rather than appropriation, sharing as opposed to owning, formats instead of forms, curation (i.e., selection) over creation, and context as the prime determinant of form rather than content. It is a culture of re- : remix, reformat, reshuffle, reinterpret, reprogram, reschedule, reboot, repost, recycle. These strategies can be seen within the world of publishing in the form of the reissue or bootleg edition—material previously out of print, but necessarily out of copyright. Miriam Katzeff and James Hoff of Primary Information republish “lost” historical material that expands contemporary discourse such as their facsimile edition of the Great Bear pamphlet series (2007), a 1960s art journal. Four Corners Books reissues literary works in a series called Familiars, which are done in collaboration with artists who provide a new spin on classics such as Dracula (2008). Vanity Fair (2010), and The Picture of Dorian Gray (2007). The more surreptitious bootleg strategy can be seen in works such as St. Pierre & Miquelon’s Sexymachineray Issue A: Super Replica (2008), a facsimile copy of a journal originally created by members of Abake: In Winterhouse Editions’ The National Security Strategy of the United States of America *2003), which simply republished and distributed the official document from the US government that would become know as the Bush Doctrine; or or ROllo Press’ How to Build Your Own Living Structures (Revisited) (2009), a one-color Riso-printed copy of Ken Issacs’ classic 1974 book on DIY furniture which can be obtained only by exchange, not purchase. The remix or extended play strategy can be seen in Extended Caption (DDDG) (2009), a reinterpretation of the content from the influential design-cum-art magazine Dot Dot Dot that Bailey published and from which forty-three artifacts and essays were selected for display and inclusion in the book as captions. Just as the introduction of the personal computer opened the sphere of publishing to broader access and participation, the Web 2.0 world not only blurs<p> the distinctions between designers and users but also between production and consumption. Labor is no longer discrete but dispersed, creation is no longer autonomous but interdependent. Consider three examples: 99designs is an online service that provides buyers a logo design for the low, low price of $99 (or, if you want exclusive rights to the design, then add another $199). Here, the art comes before the horse. Like earnest profiles on a dating site or a catalogue of mail-order brides, more than 13,000 preexisting logo designs are waiting for your “match.”  Choose one and the name of your business will be added to the design which can be further customized to meet your needs. Mechanical Turk is a service offered by Amazon.com that brings together people who need simple, so-called human intelligence tasks performed that cannot be done yet by a computer (such as judging the quality of images, identifying singers on music CDs, writing product descriptions) with those who perform them for a small fee, often just a few cents per job, resembling the digital equivalent of thousands of freelancers (i.e., contract workers) has been aggregated: outsourcing through crowdsourcing. The dubious quality and the ethical ambiguities of these enterprises aside, both of these examples are symptomatic of a larger cultural transformation around the notion of increasing immaterial labor and atomized work, and their effects on production and consumption.  Philip M. Parker, a business professor, is a prolific self-publisher who has produced more than 100,00 books using an automated process of online research, writing, and layout. He issues printed books and digital reports on a staggering range of topics, from a history of anime and medical sourcebooks in areas such as restless leg syndrome and cataract surgeries to business reports about everything from the demand for wood toilet seats in China and lemon-flavored bottled water seals in Japan to golf bag sales in India. Parker uses a “long tail” approach of selling fewer copies in many more books to niche customers. This strategy, coupled with the near elimination of human labor have produced an inverted publishing venture, one in which a detailed report highly beneficial to just a few or even one person can yield a profit with prices in the hundreds of dollars. These tasks are often accomplished in less than thirty minutes using fully automated systems, most often including print-on-demand (eliminating inventory expense), whose production expense can be measured as “12 cents of electricity.” The old schism between intellectual and manual labor that seems at the heart of the graphic design profession’s internal debates is outmoded not only because the division is theoretically suspect, but also because it considers only the actions and possible roles of its own official agents (designers) instead of the complex and fluid social relationship and networks in which they are entwined with other players, who may or may not perform their own creative and pr<p>oductive roles. Metahaven, in Whit Night Before A Manifesto (2008), explores the inability of design manifestos to effect change: “Now that the principal tools of design—the computer and its software—have been homogenized among practitioners and democratized among people, professional distinction is an unlikely perspective for a future design manifesto to gain support. User-generated content accounts not for an amateurish supplement to a stable, professional core, but for a fundamental transformation of the workforce and the value it creates. The professional core of designers will not regain the central role it once could claim based on its mastery of tools and services unavailable to users. It seems instead more probable that among those professional designers, a gap will increase between those who design as celebrity and those design as labourer. Such a gap has already appeared in the architectural profession. Subsequently, for a design manifesto, a new alliance between designers and users may be a potentially more successful way forward.” Metahaven goes on to cite the “GNU Manifesto” (1985) by Richard Stallman as a successful example of radically rethinking the entire notion of commissioned work, intellectual property rights, and collective ownership. Stallman’s proposal was one that would form the basis of the free software movement, and would inspire the open source computing, filesharing and copyleft movements. All of these take as their foundation the rights of creators to form an alliance directly with users to share their work. This declaration originally took place within a social framework very different from today’s, but prescient of its emergence. Its radical yet simple proposition, offered by a programmer—the symbolic figure of postproduction—declares: “I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it.”

		<p>The developments in typeface design, typesetting and printing have always been aimed at the improvement of “quality”. Compared to printing techniques as they existed in the early 15th century we have indeed come a long way. We can digitally output the most perfectly drawn typefaces onto film in resolutions of up to 5000 lines per inch. We can print in offset, in perfect registration, on the smoothest papers and finish it off with layers of varnish, all at a speed that our 15th century forefathers would find baffling. Technically we can create the slickest printing ever, reach the highest possible quality ever. Unfortunately, the results have too often become absolutely boring. The quality of a printed product, the high resolution of its typefaces, the perfect printing are not necessarily what makes for good design or clear communication.As a reaction to this development, we decided to create a typeface that would add liveliness to the page that has since long been lost using the modern technologies available. Our typeface would have a high resolution distortion of its digital outlines with lengthy rasterizing times as opposed to most developments in digital type: the unsmooth and slow versus the slick and quick. Type has always been in flux. Gutenberg started with whole copied pages cut from a single piece of wood. All the characters were hand-cut and no two a’s were the same. And did anyone mind? Gutenberg imitated handwriting because it was the only model of letterforms available at that time. He simply developed a process that was already there, but he succeeded in doing it faster. Only later were the advantages of movable type exploited, when hot metal type casting techniques made it possible to create large quantities of type in a relatively inexpensive fashion. This was also the period when letterforms started taking advantage of this new medium. Bodoni cut serifs so thin that it would have been impossible to produce them out of wood. It has always taken a while for people to realize the potential of a new technology. Today’s fonts work the way they do because they are still created in a hot metal, movable type kind of way. Their design is based upon the process of punchcutting, which creates a matrix from which an infinite number of identical copies of each letter can be made. Digital type may even “crash” just as hot metal typesetting did. And, ironically, digital type has resulted in a revival of old style and non-lining numerals and even small caps. The usage of type is still based upon the proverbial typecases that were divided into different compartments, each for a different letter. When a certain letter is needed, it is put in line with the others to make words and sentences. Today the typecase is replaced by a font and a digital printer. Through our experience with traditional typesetting methods, we have come to expect that the individual letterforms of a particular typeface should always look the same. This notion is the result of a technical process, no<p>t the other way round. However, there is no technical reason for making a digital letter the same every time it is printed. It is possible to calculate every point and every curve differently each time the letter is generated by slightly moving the points that define a character in various “random” directions. We discovered that it was possible to create a font featuring these characteristics in PostScript; our result was Beowolf, the first “RandomFont” typeface of its kind. [Actually, Knuth got there first and he was nice about it.] Random technology, which is what we call the programming that is involved, is about letting the rasterizer behave randomly within the boundaries of legibility. Instead of recreating a fixed outline or bitmap, the Randomfont redefines its outlines every time they are called for. Thus, each character will be different each time it is printed. All the points that define the outline of any character will be nudged in a random direction. The distance moved depends on the parameters. For instance, Beowolf 21 has a little deviation, Beowolf 22 has a noticable wrinkle and Beowolf 23 is definitely mad. What is interesting about this typeface is that the deviations in the individual letterforms create an overall unity and the liveliness of the page that we were after is accomplished. We also discovered an interesting side effect when creating color separations for four color printing. Since the printer (Linotronic in this case) generates different outlines each time it prints a particular letter, the color separation will result in four different non-matching films. The resulting letterform in print will be outlined in bright colors. While working on Randomfont we became aware that if we treated typefaces as computer data, instead of fixed letterforms, we could create some very bizarre systems. One idea was to connect a font file to a self copying moving mechanism to create a virus font; a self distributing typeface: a great way for young and ambitious type designers to get their typefaces known and used. No type manufacturer would be able to compete with that kind of immediate proliferation. Or we could change typographic awareness of computer users around the world by creating a font virus that would transform every Helvetica into something much more desirable — the Post-modern typographer’s revenge. Virowolves that travel around the world in a single day, with typedesigners getting paid by buying network shares. Or we could hand out our fonts at conferences and meetings, but after a while the files will turn sour just like milk. A perfectly good font would turn random over time. A great way to force people to eventually buy a legitimate copy. And you better hurry, or the virus font will affect your other fonts as well! We could release a typeface that deteriorates over time, slowly turning into a Beowolf-like face, scaring the hell out of its users. We could create letters that wear out through frequent use, combined with a feature that uses up certain often used letters. You want real letterpress quality? You can get it! How about a font that adds typos? Link a number of typos to a particular time of the day and simulate an erratic (human) typesetter, or a font that does not work overtime. If we put more data into our typefaces we can have some very intelligent fonts. Some applications could be quite practical. For instance the data could include the information to create automatic inktraps that would switch on or off automatically, or as specified by the user, depending on the size of the type or printing technique used. A font would modify its outline when it is to be printed in offset, or shown on TV or screened on wood, or whatever. Or a typeface could research weather data, in particular the amount of direct sunlight on the spot where it will be printed, and modify itself to the best po<p>ssible contrast. The idea of Randomfont can be applied elsewhere too. Why should a letterhead always be the same? It can be slightly different each day. If you print your correspondence or invoices on a LaserWriter, you can have a randomlogo, a logo that changes itself, moves around the page or tells something interesting about your company, the person you are writing or the nature of the letter. The dynamic logo can be much more informative than its fixed alternative. For years graphic designers, especially those who subscribe to the ideas and philosophies of Swiss design or modernism, have argued that logos and typefaces should appear consistent to establish recognition. We don’t think that this is necessary. Creating a randomlogo for a company, with letterheads and forms on which the logo would move around and change, does not necessarily decrease recognisability. Recognition does not come from simple repetition of the same form but is something much more intelligent, something that happens in our minds. When you hear somebody’s voice on the phone and he or she has a cold, you can still recognise who is talking. We can recognise handwriting, and even decipher how quickly a note was written and sometimes pick up on the state of mind the person was in when writing the note. Randomness and change can add new dimensions to printwork. Randomness within typography is not a revolutionary idea either. Typographers have always had to deal with randomness because type has always lacked standardization and consistency. One example is the measurement of type. With hot metal type everybody measured the body size of a typeface. With phototype and digital type there is no body to be measured. Some people like to measure the x-height, others the cap-height. Even the computer industry has added to the confusion. Software <p>developers in different countries have each taken their national typographic standards and type measurement units and have written programs using their respective systems. This becomes a problem when for instance software written by an American developer is sold in Europe and the user must switch to the American measurement system. There are software programs that will interpret between the various existing measurement systems, but the conversions are performed internally. So two centimeters will inevitable output as 2.0001 or 1.9999 centimeters, it never works precisely. Randomness will always exist. There is definitely not going to be a universal set of standards for type and typography. Maybe randomness is an inevitable result of human behaviour. Gutenberg’s letters came out looking slightly different each time they were printed. Letters wore out, some got damaged, the impression onto the paper differed. However, overall the printed results had a vibrant and human quality. At some point during the developement of type and typography, the graphic design industry decided that is was necessary to improve upon the “quality” of printing and type. In the process due to economic and commercial considerations, much vitality was lost. We believe that the computer, although considered by many to be cold and impersonal, can bring back some of these lost qualities. Randomfont is our contribution to this idea.</p>

		<p>Is there any reason to make new fonts when there are so many already available for downloading? It's time to reflect on motivation to draw new type. While there is no reason to make uninspired new fonts<p>, still, there are typefaces which haven’t been made yet and which we do need. It seems to be a golden age of type design—not only are there more type foundries now than ever before, not only is distribution easier and more direct, not only is type a hot topic for numerous specialised blogs and magazines, but even the general interest media are in on the conversation, (if only occasionally). New type design courses are opening regularly, churning out legions of type designers. And there are now over 150,000 fonts available for direct download. In spite of all the attention to type and the unprecedented conditions for type designers, the vast majority of new fonts desperately lack originality. Just as in the music industry, where cover versions and remixes are often more popular than new music, font designers seemingly prefer to exploit successful models from the past rather than strive for new solutions. Scant decades ago, new typefaces underwent a rigorous review procedure to ensure that they met the publisher’s artistic and technical criteria. Today, self-publishing has eliminated such processes, and there is little critical review, little effort to add something new to the evolution of the profession. Mediocrity abounds as quality control dwindles. Dozens of blogs (as well as the print media) simply republish press releases without distinguishing between marketing and independent reviews, praising uninspired fonts and institutionalising the average. Many design awards do the same, perpetuating a false idea of what constitutes superior quality. We don’t need new fonts like this. In my decade of experience teaching at Type and Media I have seen many students enter the course with no previous experience in type design. Over the eight months of the course they learn the structure of letterforms and the principles of construction that allow them to create well-designed typefaces, (not always terribly original, but convincing executions without obvious mistakes). Having mastered the formal execution of type, they can then move on to think about how to apply their skills. Obviously, creating type that is too closely related to existing models doesn’t justify the effort involved. Or as my Type and Media colleague Erik van Blokland says: “If an existing typeface does the job, there is no reason to make a new one.” Many people drawing type today have solid drawing skills, but no desire to advance the field (let alone rebel against it) by creating original solutions. Can we call them type designers? I think not, at least not any more than we can call every fast, accurate typist a writer. Content is at least as important as form, the ideas we express as important as how we express them. Still, there are typefaces which haven’t been made yet and which we need. Type that reacts to our present reality rather than being constrained by past conventions; type for non-Latin scripts that gives its users more choices; type that brings readers from previous media to new ones. It is time to think about why we design type, not just how we design it. An epistemology of the word ‘experimental’ as it applies to design and type, contrasted with its scientific connotations. Examples of past and current design, type and reading/language, as well as scientific experiment, are taken into account. Very few terms have been used so habitually and carelessly as the word ‘experiment’. In the field of graphic design and typography, experiment as a noun has been used to signify anything new, unconventional, defying easy categorization, or confounding expectations. As a verb, ‘to experiment’ is often synonymous with the design process itself, which may not exactly be helpful, considering that all design is a result of the design process. The term experiment can also have the connotation of an implicit disclaimer; it suggests not taking responsibility for the result. When students are asked what they intend by creating certain forms, they often say, ‘It’s just an experiment…’, when they don’t have a better response. In a scientific context, an experiment is a test of an idea; a set of actions performed to prove or disprove a hypothesis. Experimentation in this sense is an empirical approach to knowledge that lays a foundation upon which others can build. It requires all measurements to be made objectively under controlled conditions, which allows the procedure to be repeated by others, thus proving that a phenomenon occurs after a certain action, and that the phenomenon does not occur in the absence of the action. An example of a famous scientific experiment would be Galileo Galilei’s dropping of two objects of different weights from the Pisa tower to demonstrate that both would land at the same time, proving his hypothesis about gravity. In this sense, a typographic experiment might be a procedure to determine whether humidity affects the transfer of ink onto a sheet of paper, and if it does, how. A scientific approach to experimentation, however, seems to be valid only in a situation where empirical knowledge is applicable, or in a situation where the outcome of the experiment can be reliably measured. What happens however when the outcome is ambiguous, non-objective, not based on pure reason? In the recent book The Typographic Experiment: Radical Innovation in Contemporary Type Design, the author Teal Triggs asked thirty-seven internationally-recognized designers to define their understandings of the term experiment. As expected, the published definitions couldn’t have been more disparate. They are marked by personal belief systems and biased by the experiences of the designers. While Hamish Muir of 8vo writes: ‘Every type job is experiment’, Melle Hammer insists that: ‘Experimental typography does not exist, nor ever has’. So how is it possible that there are such diverse understandings of a term that is so commonly used? Among the designers’ various interpretations, two notions of experimentation were dominant. The first one was formulated by the American designer David Carson: ‘Experimental is something I haven’t tried before … something that hasn’t been seen and heard’. Carson and several other designers suggest that the nature of experiment lies in the formal novelty of the result. There are many precedents for this opinion, but in an era when information travels faster than ever before and when we have achieved unprecedented archival of information, it becomes significantly more difficult to claim a complete novelty of forms. While over ninety years ago Kurt Schwitters proclaimed that to ‘do it in a way that no one has done it before’ was sufficient for the definition of the new typography of his day — and his work was an appropriate example of such an approach — today things are different. Designers are more aware of the body of work and the discourse accompanying it. Proclaiming novelty today can seem like historical ignorance on a designer’s part. Interestingly, Carson’s statement also suggests that the essence of experimentation is in going against the prevailing patterns, rather than being guided by conventions. This is directly opposed to the scientific usage of the word, where an experiment is designed to add to the accumulation of knowledge; in design, where results are measured subjectively, there is a tendency to go against the generally accepted base of knowledge. In science a single person can make valuable experiments, but a design experiment that is rooted in anti-conventionalism can only exist against the background of other — conventional — solutions. In this sense, it would be impossible to experiment if one were the only designer on earth, because there would be no standard for the experiment. Anti-conventionalism requires going against prevailing styles, which is perceived as conventional. If more designers joined forces and worked in a similar fashion, the scale would change, and the former convention would become anti-conventional. The fate of such experimentation is a permanent confrontation with the mainstream; a circular, cyclical race, where it is not certain who is chasing whom. Does type design and typography allow an experimental approach at all? The alphabet is by its very nature dependent on and defined by conventions. Type design that is not bound by convention is like a private language: both lack the ability to communicate. Yet it is precisely the constraints of the alphabet which inspire many designers. A recent example is the work of Thomas Huot-Marchand, a French postgraduate student of type-design who investigates the limits of legibility while physically reducing the basic forms of the alphabet. Minuscule is his project of size-specific typography. While the letters for regular reading sizes are very close to conventional book typefaces, each step down in size results in simplification of the letter-shapes. In the extremely small sizes (2pt) Miniscule becomes an abstract reduction of the alphabet, free of all the details and optical corrections which are usual for fonts designed for text reading. Huot-Marchand’s project builds upon the work of French ophthalmologist Loui<p>s Emile Javal, who published similar research at the beginning of the 20th century. The practical contribution of both projects is limited, since the reading process is still guided by the physical limitations of the human eye, however, Huot-Marchand and Javal both investigate the constraints of legibility within which typography functions. The second dominant notion of experiment in The Typographic Experiment was formulated by Michael Worthington, a British designer and educator based in the USA: ‘True experimentation means to take risks.’ If taken literally, such a statement is of little value: immediately we would ask what is at stake and what typographers are really risking. Worthington, however, is referring to the risk involved with not knowing the exact outcome of the experiment in which the designers are engaged. A similar definition is offered by the E.A.T. (Experiment And Typography) exhibition presenting 35 type designers and typographers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which coincidentally will arrive in the Netherlands shortly. Alan Záruba and Johanna Balušíková, the curators of E.A.T. put their focus on development and process when describing the concept of the exhibition: ‘The show focuses on projects which document the development of designers’ ideas. Attention is paid to the process of creating innovative solutions in the field of type design and typography, often engaging experimental processes as a means to approach unknown territory.’ An experiment in this sense has no preconceived idea of the outcome; it only sets out to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. As such, experimentation is a method of working which is contrary to production-oriented design, where the aim of the process is not to create something new, but to achieve an already known, pre-formulated result. Belgian designer Brecht Cuppens has created Sprawl, an experimental typeface based on cartography, which takes into account the density of population in Belgium. In Sprawl, the silhouette of each letter is identical, so that when typed they lock into each other. The filling of the letters however varies according to the frequency of use of the letter in the Dutch language. The most frequently used letter (e) represents the highest density of population. The most infrequently used letter (q) corresponds to the lowest density. Setting a sample text creates a Cupp<p>ens representation of the Belgian landscape. Another example of experiment as a process of creation without anticipation of the fixed result is an online project . Ortho-type Trio of authors, Enrico Bravi, Mikkel Crone Koser, and Paolo Palma, describe ortho-type as ‘an exercise in perception, a stimulus for the mind and the eye to pick out and process three-dimensional planes on a flat surface…’. Ortho-type is an online application of a typeface designed to be recognizable in three dimensions. In each view, the viewer can set any of the available variables: length, breadth, depth, thickness, colour and rotation, and generate multiple variations of the model. The user can also generate those variations as a traditional 2D PostScript font. Although this kind of experimental process has no commercial application, its results may feed other experiments and be adapted to commercial activities. Once assimilated, the product is no longer experimental. David Carson may have started his formal experiments out of curiosity, but now similar formal solutions have been adapted by commercial giants such as Nike, Pepsi, or Sony. Following this line, we can go further to suggest that no completed project can be seriously considered experimental. It is experimental only in the process of its creation. When completed it only becomes part of the body of work which it was meant to challenge. As soon as the experiment achieves its final form it can be named, categorized and analyzed according to any conventional system of classification and referencing. An experimental technique which is frequently used is to bring together various working methods which are recognized separately but rarely combined. For example, language is studied systematically by linguists, who are chiefly interested in spoken languages and in the problems of analyzing them as they operate at a given point in time. Linguists rarely, however, venture into the visible representation of language, because they consider it artificial and thus secondary to spoken langu<p>age. Typographers on the other hand are concerned with the appearance of type in print and other reproduction technologies; they often have substantial knowledge of composition, color theories, proportions, paper, etc., yet often lack knowledge of the language which they represent. These contrasting interests are brought together in the work of Pierre di Sciullo, a French designer who pursues his typographic research in a wide variety of media. His typeface Sintétik reduces the letters of the French alphabet to the core phonemes (sounds which distinguish one word from another) and compresses it to 16 characters. Di Sciullo stresses the economic aspect of such a system, with an average book being reduced by about 30% percent when multiple spellings of the same sound are made redundant. For example, the French words for skin (peaux) and pot (pot) are both reduced to the simplest representation of their pronunciation — po. Words set in Sintétik can be understood only when read aloud returning the reader to the medieval experience of oral reading. Quantange is another font specific to the French language. It is basically a phonetic alphabet which visually suggests the pronunciation, rhythm and pace of reading. Every letter in Quantange has as many different shapes as there are ways of pronouncing it: the letter c for example has two forms because it can be pronounced as s or k. Di Sciullo suggests that Quantange would be particularly useful to foreign students of French or to actors and presenters who need to articulate the inflectional aspect of language not indicated by traditional scripts. This project builds on experiments of early avant-garde designers, the work of the Bauhaus, Kurt Schwitters, and Jan Tschichold. Di Sciullo took inspiration from the reading process, when he designed a typeface for setting the horizontal palindromes of Georges Perec (Perec has written the longest palindrome on record, a poem of 1388 words which can be read both ways, see http://graner.net/nicolas/salocin/ten.renarg//:ptth). The typeface is a combination of lower and upper case and is designed to be read from both sides, left and right. (This is great news to every Bob, Hannah or Eve.) Di Sciullo’s typefaces are very playful and their practical aspects are limited, yet like the other presented examples of experiments in typography, his works points to previously unexplored areas of interest which enlarge our understanding of the field. Although most of the examples shown here are marked by the recent shift of interest of European graphic design from forms to ideas, and the best examples combine both, there is no definitive explanation of what constitutes an experiment in typography. As the profession develops and more people practice this subtle art, we continually redefine the purpose of experimentation and become aware of its moving boundaries.

		Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all the virtues of the <p>perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at the most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried by the fear of 'doubling' lines, reading three words as one, and so forth. Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a 'modernist' in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he asked of his particular object was not 'How should it look?' but 'What must it do?' and to that extent all good typography is modernist. Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the central ritual of religion in one place and time, and attacked by a virago with a hatchet in another. There is only one thing in the world that is capable of stirring and altering men's minds to the same extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's chief miracle, unique to man. There is no 'explanation' whatever of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds which will lead a total stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking, broadcasting, writing, and printing are all quite literally forms of thought transference, and it is the ability and eagerness to transfer and receive the contents of the mind that is almost alone responsible for human civilization. If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, i.e. that the most important thing about <p>printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography. Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house altogether. Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does not necessarily lead to. If books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility. A page set in 14-pt Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory tests, more 'legible' than one set in 11-pt Baskerville. A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the transparent goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to the inflections and <p>speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you are falling asleep. When you listen to a song in a language you do not understand, part of your mind actually does fall asleep, leaving your quite separate aesthetic sensibilities to enjoy themselves unimpeded by your reasoning faculties. The fine arts do that; but that is not the purpose of printing. Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas. We may say, therefore, that printing may be delightful for many reasons, but that it is important, first and foremost, as a means of doing something. That is why it is mischievous to <p>call any printed piece a work of art, especially fine art: because that would imply that its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for the delectation of the senses. Calligraphy can almost be considered a fine art nowadays, because its primary economic and educational purpose has been taken away; but printing in English will not qualify as an art until the present English language no longer conveys ideas to future generations, and until printing itself hands its usefulness to some yet unimagined successor. There is no end to the maze of practices in typography, and this idea of printing as a conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great typographers with whom I have had the privilege of talking, the one clue that can guide you through the maze. Without this essential humility of mind, I have seen ardent designers go more hopelessly wrong, make more ludicrous mistakes out of an excessive enthusiasm, than I could have thought possible. And with this clue, this purposiveness in the back of your mind, it is possible to do the most unheard-of things, and find that they justify you triumphantly. It is not a waste of time to go to the simple fundamentals and reason from them. In the flurry of your individual problems, I think you will not mind spending half an hour on one broad and simple set of ideas involving abstract principles. I once was talking to a man who designed a very pleasing advertising type which undoubtedly all of you have used. I said something about what artists think about a certain problem, <p>and he replied with a beautiful gesture: 'Ah, madam, we artists do not think---we feel!' That same day I quoted that remark to another designer of my acquaintance, and he, being less poetically inclined, murmured: 'I'm not feeling very well today, I think!' He was right, he did think; he was the thinking sort; and that is why he is not so good a painter, and to my mind ten times better as a typographer and type designer than the man who instinctively avoided anything as coherent as a reason. I always suspect the typographic enthusiast who takes a printed page from a book and frames it to hang on the wall, for I believe that in order to gratify a sensory delight he has mutilated something infinitely more important. I remember that T.M. Cleland, the famous American typographer, once showed me a very beautiful layout for a Cadillac booklet involving decorations in colour. He did not have the actual text to work with in drawing up his specimen pages, so he had set the lines in Latin. This was not only for the reason that you will all think of; if you have seen the old typefoundries' famous Quousque Tandem copy (i.e. that Latin has few descenders and thus gives a remarkably even line). No, he told me that originally he had set up the dullest 'wording' that he could find (I dare say it was from Hansard), and yet he discovered that the man to whom he submitted it would start reading and making comments on the text. I made some remark on the mentality of Boards of Directors, but Mr Cleland said, 'No: you're wrong; if the reader had not been practically forced to read---if he had not seen those words suddenly imbued with glamour and significance---then the layout would have been a failure. Setting it in Italian or Latin is only an easy way of saying "This is not the text as it will appear".'Let me start my specific conclusions with book typography, because that contains all the fundamentals, and then go on to a few points about advertising. <p>The book typographer has the job of erecting a window between the reader inside the room and that landscape which is the author's words. He may put up a stained-glass window of marvellous beauty, but a failure as a window; that is, he may use some rich superb type like text gothic that is something to be looked at, not through. Or he may work in what I call transparent or invisible typography. I have a book at home, of which I have no visual recollection whatever as far as its typography goes; when I think of it, all I see is the <p>Three Musketeers and their comrades swaggering up and down the streets of Paris. The third type of window is one in which the glass is broken into relatively small leaded panes; and this corresponds to what is called 'fine printing' today, in that you are at least conscious that there is a window there, and that someone has enjoyed building it. That is not objectionable, because of a very important fact which has to do with the psychology of the subconscious mind. That is that the mental eye focuses through type and not upon it. The type which, through any arbitrary warping of design or excess of 'colour', gets in the way of the mental picture to be conveyed, is a bad type. Our subconsciousness is always afraid of blunders (which illogical setting, tight spacing and too-wide unleaded lines can trick us into), of boredom, and of officiousness. The running headline that keeps shouting at us, the line that looks like one long word, the capitals jammed together without hair-spaces---these mean subconscious squinting and loss of mental focus.And if what I have said is true of book printing, even of the most exquisite limited editions, it is fifty times more obvious in advertising, where the one and only justification for the purchase of space is that you are conveying a message---that you are implanting a desire, straight into the mind of the reader. It is tragically easy to throw away half the reader-interest of an advertisement by setting the simple and compelling argument in a face which is uncomfortably <p>alien to the classic reasonableness of the book-face. Get attention as you will by your headline, and make any pretty type pictures you like if you are sure that the copy is useless as a means of selling goods; but if you are happy enough to have really good copy to work with, I beg you to remember that thousands of people pay hard-earned money for the privilege of reading quietly set book-pages, and that only your wildest ingenuity can stop people from reading a really interesting text. Printing demands a humility of mind, for the lack of which many of the fine arts are even now floundering in self-conscious and maudlin experiments. Vulgar ostentation is twice as easy as discipline. When you realise that ugly typography never effaces itself; you will be able to capture beauty as the wise men capture happiness by aiming at something else. The 'stunt typographer' learns the fickleness of rich men who hate to read. Not for them are long breaths held over serif and kern, they will not appreciate your splitting of hair-spaces. Nobody (save the other craftsmen) will appreciate half your skill. But you may spend endless years of happy experiment in <p>devising that crystalline goblet which is worthy to hold the vintage of the human mind. (Originally printed in London in 1932, under the pseudonym Paul Beaujon. This version printed in London 1955). <p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you will find that almost all the virtues of <p>the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page? Again: the glass is colourless or at the most only faintly tinged in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its colour and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting port in tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of setting lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the reader subconsciously worried by the fear of 'doubling' lines, reading three words as one, and so forth. Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a 'modernist' in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he asked of his particular object was not 'How should it look?' but 'What must it do?' and to that extent all good typography is modernist. Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the central ritual of religion in one place and time, and attacked by a virago with a hatchet in another. There is only one thing in the world that is capable of stirring and altering men's minds to the same extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's chief miracle, unique to man. There is no 'explanation' whatever of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds which will lead a total stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be <p>able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking, broadcasting, writing, and printing are all quite literally forms of thought transference, and it is the ability and eagerness to transfer and receive the contents of the mind that is almost alone responsible for human civilization. If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, i.e. that the most important thing about printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography. Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house altogether. Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does not necessarily lead to. If books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility. A page set in 14-pt Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory tests, more 'legible' than one set in 11-pt Baskerville. A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice. It is the transparent goblet again!
